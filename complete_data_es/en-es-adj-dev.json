Los fármacos no se deben interrumpir, sin embargo, se aconseja que se utilice un único fármaco antiepiléptico y que se use en la mínima dosis posible, estudios indican que algunos antiepilépticos pueden provocar malformaciones de distinto tipo además de nacer con un menor coeficiente intelectual.

  "premise": "In women of childbearing age, use of antiepileptic drugs is a major concern balancing possible side effects on the fetus against risk from uncontrolled seizures. Use of AEDs entail teratogenic effects including intrauterine growth retardation, major congenital malformations, and developmental (neurocognitive) and behavioral issues, that need to be discussed with the patient at the time of starting the AEDs and before they plan pregnancy. Most women with epilepsy receive safe and effective treatment and have normal children, however, risks exist. The International League Against Epilepsy created a task force on women and epilepsy which published consensus recommendations to guide therapy decisions until more definitive evidence is available in the future.",

I'm assuming they meant \"de las epilépticas en el embarazo\".  ",

He identified the bread and cup of wine as his body, soon to be sacrificed, and his blood, soon to be shed. The Apostle Paul states, in his First Epistle to the Corinthians, \"Get rid of the old yeast that you may be a new batch without yeast—as you really are. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.

  "text": "Apolo 11 fue la quinta misión tripulada del Programa Apolo de los Estados Unidos y la primera de la historia en lograr que un ser humano llegara a la Luna. La nave Apolo de la misión se envió al espacio el 16 de julio de 1969, realizó su alunizaje el 20 de julio de ese mismo año y al día siguiente dos astronautas (Armstrong y Aldrin) se convirtieron en los primeros en caminar sobre la superficie lunar. El Apolo11 fue impulsado por un cohete Saturno V desde la plataforma LC 39A y lanzado a las 13:32 UTC del complejo de cabo Kennedy, en Florida (EE. UU.). Oficialmente se conoció a la misión como AS-506. La misión fue un hito decisivo de la NASA contra el programa espacial de la Unión Soviética durante la carrera espacial y está considerada como uno de los momentos más significativos en la historia de la humanidad.",

  "premise": "Apollo 11 (July 16–24, 1969) was the American spaceflight that first landed humans on the Moon. Commander Neil Armstrong and lunar module pilot Buzz Aldrin landed the Apollo Lunar Module Eagle on July 20, 1969, at 20:17 UTC, and Armstrong became the first person to step onto the Moon's surface six hours and 39 minutes later, on July 21 at 02:56 UTC. Aldrin joined him 19 minutes later, and they spent about two and a quarter hours together exploring the site they had named Tranquility Base upon landing. Armstrong and Aldrin collected of lunar material to bring back to Earth as pilot Michael Collins flew the Command Module Columbia in lunar orbit, and were on the Moon's surface for 21 hours, 36 minutes before lifting off to rejoin Columbia.",

  "text": "La conceptualización psiquiátrica contemporánea de la enfermedad maníaco-depresiva es usualmente fechada cerca de 1850. El 31 de enero de 1854, Jules Baillarger describió a la Academia de Medicina del Imperio Francés una enfermedad mental de dos fases que causa oscilaciones entre la manía y la depresión. Dos semanas después, el 14 de febrero, Jean-Pierre Falret presentó una descripción a la Academia de lo que era esencialmente el mismo trastorno. Esta enfermedad fue designada como folie circulaire (locura circular) por Falret, y como folie à double forme (locura de forma dual) por Baillarger .",

  "premise": "In the early 1800s, French psychiatrist Jean-Étienne Dominique Esquirol's lypemania, one of his affective monomanias, was the first elaboration on what was to become modern depression. The basis of the current conceptualization of bipolar illness can be traced back to the 1850s. In 1850, Jean-Pierre Falret described \"circular insanity\" (la folie circulaire, ); the lecture was summarized in 1851 in the \"Gazette des hôpitaux\" (\"Hospital Gazette\"). Three years later, in 1854, Jules-Gabriel-François Baillarger (1809–1890) described to the French Imperial Académie Nationale de Médecine a biphasic mental illness causing recurrent oscillations between mania and melancholia, which he termed folie à double forme (, \"madness in double form\"). Baillarger's original paper, \"De la folie à double forme,\" appeared in the medical journal Annales médico-psychologiques (Medico-psychological annals) in 1854.",

I think the Spanish expression \"se remonta a\" would be more accurate. \nThe English version states \"to the 1950s\" (so, 1950-1959), whereas the Spanish version states \"cerca de 1950\" (near 1950), which could be a couple of years before 1950. \nThe Spanish version presents Falret's contribution after Baillarger's (two weeks after on February 14th 1954), while the English version presents it as previous to it (4 years before, in 1950).\nThe English version doesn't clearly state that Falret's \"folie circulaire\" and Baillarger's \"folie a double forme\" are exactly the same illness, like the Spanish version does.

For example, the 6d electron levels (also split in two, with four being 6d3/2 and six being 6d5/2) are both raised, so they are close in energy to the 7s ones, although no 6d electron chemistry has been predicted for tennessine. The difference between the 7p1/2 and 7p3/2 levels is abnormally high; 9.8 eV. Astatine's 6p subshell split is only 3.8 eV, and its 6p1/2 chemistry has already been called \"limited\".

SV adds words that may be easily inferable for someone with a background in the subject, but that are much appreciated for clarity purposes for someone who's not familiar with it, like me. Also, a couple of spans like \"Como comparación\" (By comparison) or \"Tomados en conjunto, todos\" (Altogether, all) add to the clarity of the paragraph by connecting sentences in a logical way. \n\nI think there's something missing in SV, probably a typo. \"diferencias química\" is either missing an \"s\" at the end of the second word for \"diferencias químicas\" (chemical differences) or is missing \"en la\" between the two words for \"diferencias en la química\" (differences in the chemistry). I don't think it changes the meaning, though. ",

  "text": "Los pangolines llegan a su madurez sexual a la edad de 2 años. Mientras que las especies africanas suelen tener una cría por gestación, las especies asiáticas pueden tener entre una y tres. Los pangolines se pueden reproducir en cualquier época del año, aunque los nacimientos son más frecuentes entre noviembre y marzo. Como habitualmente son animales solitarios, los machos y las hembras se tienen que encontrar los unos a los otros siguiendo el rastro del olor. La gestación dura entre cuatro y 5 meses, excepto en el caso del pangolín de Filipinas, que sólo dura dos meses.",

  "premise": "Gestation periods differ by species, ranging from roughly 70 to 140 days. African pangolin females usually give birth to a single offspring at a time, but the Asiatic species may give birth to from one to three. Weight at birth is , and the average length is . At the time of birth, the scales are soft and white. After several days, they harden and darken to resemble those of an adult pangolin. During the vulnerable stage, the mother stays with her offspring in the burrow, nursing it, and wraps her body around it if she senses danger. The young cling to the mother's tail as she moves about, although, in burrowing species, they remain in the burrow for the first 2–4 weeks of life. At one month, they first leave the burrow riding on the mother's back. Weaning takes place around 3 months of age, when the young begin to eat insects in addition to nursing. At 2 years of age, the offspring are sexually mature and are abandoned by the mother.",

  "text": "Ese mismo año conoció a uno de los grandes amores de su vida, Charles-Joseph Lamoral, príncipe de Ligne. Inició una apasionada relación con él, hasta que quedó embarazada y el príncipe la abandonó. El 22 de diciembre de 1864 dio a luz a su único hijo, Maurice Bernhardt. Sin oficio y habiendo fracasado momentáneamente en el mundo del teatro, siguió los pasos de su madre, convirtiéndose en prostituta de lujo. Sarah no abandonó su actividad como cortesana hasta que su carrera teatral se hubo afianzado con éxito y pudo mantenerse solo con el trabajo que le reportaba el teatro.",
  "pair_type": "en-es",
  "premise": "Early in Bernhardt's career, she had an affair with a Belgian nobleman, Charles-Joseph Eugène Henri Georges Lamoral de Ligne (1837–1914), son of Eugène, 8th Prince of Ligne, with whom she bore her only child, Maurice Bernhardt (1864–1928). Maurice did not become an actor, but worked for most of his life as a manager and agent for various theatres and performers, frequently managing his mother's career in her later years, but rarely with great success. Maurice and his family were usually financially dependent, in full or in part, on his mother until her death. Maurice married a Polish princess, Maria Jablonowska, of the House of Jablonowski, with whom he had two daughters: Simone, who married Edgar Gross, son of a wealthy Philadelphia soap manufacturer; and Lysiana, who married the playwright Louis Verneuil.",

An affair could refer to a single sexual encounter and still bring a child into the world. Also, if the word affair is used to mean that there was infidelity from one or both parties involved, a passionate relationship doesn't necessarily imply it. ",

Along with the Han Chinese in and outside Greater China, as many as 29 of the 55 ethnic minority groups in China also celebrate Chinese New Year.

C.). Se erigía sobre un podium alto con una escalinata de entrada en su frente. En tres de sus lados estaba probablemente flanqueado por una columnata y tenía otras dos filas de pilares dispuestos en línea con las de la fachada para formar un profundo pronao que precedía los tres cellae que iban de lado a lado a la manera etrusca, siendo la central más ancha que las otras dos.",

Jupiter was worshiped there as an individual deity, and with Juno and Minerva as part of the Capitoline Triad. The building was supposedly begun by king Tarquinius Priscus, completed by the last king (Tarquinius Superbus) and inaugurated in the early days of the Roman Republic (September 13, 509 BC). It was topped with the statues of four horses drawing a quadriga, with Jupiter as charioteer. A large statue of Jupiter stood within; on festival days, its face was painted red. In (or near) this temple was the Iuppiter Lapis: the Jupiter Stone, on which oaths could be sworn.",

Since the previous sentence ended with \"globally\", I'm assuming \"overall\" means \"globally\", whereas the equivalent sentence in the Spanish version localizes that percentage in developed countries, so I'm labeling \"En países desarrollados\" as \"New Information\". Even though \"developed countries\" as a category is a subsystem of \"globally\", I wouldn't label it as \"Inferable\" because specific regions can have higher or lower percentages than the global average. Also, the equivalent sentence in Spanish uses the word \"personas\" (people) instead of \"adults\", which are not necessarily interchangeable. Heart failure can also occur in children and adolescents, so I'm labeling it as \"New information\".",

En su lugar, se celebra la \"Liturgia de la Pasión del Señor\" a media tarde del viernes, a las 15:00, hora en la que se ha situado la muerte de Jesús en la cruz. Por razones pastorales puede anticiparse o celebrarse más tarde, aunque en ningún caso la celebración puede comenzar antes de las 12:00 ni concluir pasadas las 21:00. Los únicos sacramentos que se celebran durante este tiempo son el bautismo (en caso de peligro de muerte), la penitencia y la unción de enfermos. ",

  "premise": "The Roman Rite has no celebration of Mass between the Lord's Supper on Holy Thursday evening and the Easter Vigil unless a special exemption is granted for rare solemn or grave occasions by the Vatican or the local bishop. The only sacraments celebrated during this time are Baptism (for those in danger of death), Penance, and Anointing of the Sick. While there is no celebration of the Eucharist, it is distributed to the faithful only in the Celebration of the Lord's Passion, but can also be taken at any hour to the sick who are unable to attend this celebration.

It is connected to the Black Sea by the Strait of Kerch, which at its narrowest has a width of and a maximum depth of . The narrowness of the Kerch Strait limits the water exchange with the Black Sea. As a result, the salinity of the Sea of Azov is low; in the open sea it is 10–12 psu, about one third of the salinity of the oceans; it is even lower (2–7 psu) in the Taganrog Bay at the northeast end of the Sea. The long-term variations of salinity are within a few psu and are mostly caused by changes in humidity and precipitation.",

Although these have contributed to the extinction of native fish by causing significant changes to the ecosystem, outcompeted natives and (in the case of the Nile tilapia) possibly hybridized with the highly threatened native tilapias, the most infamous introduction was the large and highly predatory Nile perch (Lates niloticus).",

EV highlights the responsibility of the perch, while SV is taking away from it. \n highly predatory / enorme voracidad (huge voracity/voraciousness): I think they're equivalent in this context, but not necessarily in general terms (perhaps in another situation one could think of an animal with a huge appetite that is not very effective at preying).

It was established in 1936 with legacies from the pharmaceutical magnate Henry Wellcome (founder of one of the predecessors of GlaxoSmithKline) to fund research to improve human and animal health. The aim of the Trust is to \"support science to solve the urgent health challenges facing everyone.\" It had a financial endowment of £29.1 billion in 2020, making it the fourth wealthiest charitable foundation in the world. In 2012, the Wellcome Trust was described by the Financial Times as the United Kingdom's largest provider of non-governmental funding for scientific research, and one of the largest providers in the world. According to their annual report, the Wellcome Trust spent GBP £1.1Bn on charitable activities across their 2019/2020 financial year. According to the OECD, the Wellcome Trust's financing for 2019 development increased by 22% to US$327 million.",

  "text": "La más extensa, detallada e influyente obra sobre la vida de Pitágoras y su pensamiento data del , es decir, unos 800 años después de su muerte. Diógenes Laercio (ca. 200-250) y Porfirio (ca. 234-305) escribieron dos Vidas de Pitágoras, y Jámblico (ca. 245-325) Sobre la vida pitagórica. Estas biografías son, con algunas excepciones,Jenófanes, Heráclito, Heródoto, Platón, Aristóteles e Isócrates. Pertenecen a una época en que la figura de Pitágoras era vista de modo distorsionado y se basan, a su vez, en fuentes extraviadas, algunas de las cuales son de marcada tendencia neopitagórica y deliberadamente orientadas a ensalzar a Pitágoras, presentándolo como el origen de toda la verdad filosófica, cuyas ideas habrían sido plagiadas por Platón, Aristóteles y todos los filósofos posteriores.",

  "premise": "Most of the major sources on Pythagoras's life are from the Roman period, by which point, according to the German classicist Walter Burkert, \"the history of Pythagoreanism was already... the laborious reconstruction of something lost and gone.\" Three ancient biographies of Pythagoras have survived from late antiquity, all of which are filled primarily with myths and legends. The earliest and most respectable of these is the one from Diogenes Laërtius's Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers. The two later biographies were written by the Neoplatonist philosophers Porphyry and Iamblichus and were partially intended as polemics against the rise of Christianity. The later sources are much lengthier than the earlier ones, and even more fantastic in their descriptions of Pythagoras's achievements. Porphyry and Iamblichus used material from the lost writings of Aristotle's disciples and material taken from these sources is generally considered to be the most reliable.",

Murió de una neumonía . en la estación ferroviaria de Astápovo (actualmente, Lev Tolstói en la óblast de Lípetsk), después de caer enfermo cuando abandonó su casa a mediados de invierno. Su muerte llegó luego de huir del estilo de vida aristocrático y separarse de su esposa. Tolstói había intentado renunciar a sus propiedades en favor de los pobres, aunque su familia, en especial su esposa, Sofía Behrs, lo impidió. Este fue uno de los motivos por los que Tolstói había decidido abandonar su hogar.",

In his last days, he spoke and wrote about dying. Renouncing his aristocratic lifestyle, he left home one winter night. His secretive departure was an apparent attempt to escape from his wife's tirades. She spoke out against many of his teachings, and in recent years had grown envious of his attention to Tolstoyan \"disciples\".",

Primero, una sequía seguida de inundaciones en la provincia de Shandong en 1897-1898 obligó a los agricultores a huir a las ciudades y buscar comida. Como dijo un observador: \"Estoy convencido de que unos días de fuertes lluvias para poner fin a la prolongada sequía harían más para restaurar la tranquilidad que cualquier medida que el gobierno chino o los gobiernos extranjeros puedan tomar\".",

The Western success at controlling China, growing anti-imperialist sentiment, and extreme weather conditions, sparked the movement. A drought followed by floods in Shandong province in 1897–1898 forced farmers to flee to cities and seek food.",

  "text": "En agosto de 2005, poco antes de aparecer en Get Rich or Die Tryin', Jackson publicó una autobiografía titulada From Pieces to Weight: Once Upon a Time in Southside Queens. En la misma, Jackson explora las fuerzas culturales y económicas que lo llevaron a vender cocaína y crack, los detalles de su actividad empresarial como un narcotraficante y luego como rapero, y reflexiona sobre su propio carácter y en la sociedad. El 4 de enero de 2007, Jackson lanzó su imprenta G-Unit Books en el edificio de Time Warner. También coescribió The Ski Mask Way, una novela sobre un pequeño traficante de drogas que intenta robar a sus empleadores, la cual se convirtió en una película. Jackson dijo que leyó The 33 Strategies of War de Robert Greene, y trabajó con el autor en un libro titulado The 50th Law, una toma urbana de Las 48 leyes del poder. En mayo de 2008, Jackson se unió al multimillonario Patrice Motsepe para forjar una sociedad conjunta de venta de 50 Cent-platino de marca.",
  "pair_type": "en-es",
  "premise": "Jackson has also started a book publishing imprint, G-Unit Books on January 4, 2007, at the Time Warner Building in New York. He has written a number of books including a memoir, From Pieces To Weight in 2005 where it sold 73,000 copies in hardcover and 14,000 copies in paperback; a crime novel and a book with Robert Greene titled The 50th Law, an urban take on The 48 Laws of Power. In November 2011, Jackson released 50 Cent's Playground, a young adult fiction novel about a bullied, violent boy and his gay mother.",

  "text": "Ernst Haeckel fue un ferviente evolucionista. Sus ideas al respecto fueron recogidas en 1866 en su Generelle Morphologie der Organismen (Morfología general de los organismos), cuyo segundo volumen dedicó a Charles Darwin, Wolfgang Goethe y Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. No obstante, aunque Haeckel fue un gran defensor de la idea de selección natural, en realidad ignoró el papel del azar en la teoría darwinista. Su evolucionismo aceptaba muchas de las ideas de Lamarck y la Naturphilosophie. Radicalmente progresista, Haeckel defendió que la evolución estaba dirigida hacia una complejización progresiva que tendría al hombre como meta última. Haeckel era, además, radicalmente materialista y monista y consideró la evolución como una de las mejores pruebas de dicha filosofía.",
  "pair_type": "en-es",
  "premise": "Haeckel was a zoologist, an accomplished artist and illustrator, and later a professor of comparative anatomy. Although Haeckel's ideas are important to the history of evolutionary theory, and although he was a competent invertebrate anatomist most famous for his work on radiolaria, many speculative concepts that he championed are now considered incorrect. For example, Haeckel described and named hypothetical ancestral microorganisms that have never been found.",

I'm assuming that perhaps, similarly to the previous note, they started admitting undergraduate students after 2021 (after the Spanish version was written).

La palabra cheeseburger es un acrónimo en inglés que cubre la palabra 'cheese' (queso) y 'burger' (hamburguesa). Otros restaurantes han reclamado la invención de esta hamburguesa como parte de la leyenda de sus propios locales. Un ejemplo es el restaurante Kaelin en Louisville, Kentucky reclamó su invención en 1934. Pero durante los siguientes años, la marca registrada para el nombre \"cheeseburger\" fue adquirida por Louis Ballast para el restaurante Humpty Dumpty de tipo Drive-In en Denver, Colorado.",

One year later, a trademark for the name \"cheeseburger\" was awarded to Louis Ballast of the Humpty Dumpty Drive-In in Denver, Colorado. According to Steak 'n Shake archives, the restaurant's founder, Gus Belt, applied for a trademark on the word in the 1930s ",

Inicialmente perteneció a España mediante el Tratado de Tordesillas, y después fue añadida por la corona portuguesa por el Tratado de Madrid de 1750. En 1822, con la independencia, pasó a pertenecer a Brasil, pero sus fronteras con los países de habla hispana no estaban definidas antes del Tratado Vásquez Cobo-Martins, que reconoció las posesiones brasileñas en el norte del estado de Amazonas.",

The internal conflicts within that neighbour country resulted in the emergence of Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela and Panama. Brazil signed the Treaty Vásquez Cobo–Martins (1908) (with those countries) finally entitling those possessions in the north to Brazil. One region is marked by the geodesic line Apóporis-Tabatinga; and the other is the municipal area of São Gabriel da Cachoeira, on the Brazil-Colombia border.",

The group forms a protective front with the foals in the centre, and the stallion will rush at predators that come too close. In Grévy's zebras, young stay in \"kindergartens\" when their mothers leave for water. These groups are tended to by the territorial male. A stallion may look after a foal in his territory to ensure that the mother stays, though it may not be his. By contrast, plains zebra stallions are generally intolerant of foals that are not theirs and may practice infanticide and feticide via violence to the pregnant mare.",

However, one wouldn't necessarily know from EV the makeup of the group (how many males, how many females) or from SV that the entire group is involved.\nContradictory info: \"los potros de cebra de Grévy sólo tienen a su madre como protectora habitual\" (the Grévy's zebras' foals only have their mother as their usual protector) /  In Grévy's zebras, young stay in \"kindergartens\" when their mothers leave for water.

The protection of foals is especially relevant for these animals, since the pups are an easy prey for predators and half of them do not survive the first year of life despite the efforts of their mother and the male of the group.

Their relationship was extensively publicized, with tabloids referring to the couple as Bennifer, the first celebrity portmanteau of its kind. They appeared together in the music video for her song \"Jenny from the Block\" and the film Jersey Girl. Then was dedicated to and inspired by Affleck. They became engaged in November 2002 but their planned wedding on September 14, 2003, was postponed with four days' notice because of \"excessive media attention\".

  "text": "A finales del , Henri Bergson reconoció la risa como fundamentalmente social. Define la risa como un fenómeno exclusivamente humano: aunque otros animales pueden manifestar síntomas parecidos a la risa, solo los seres humanos ríen de verdad. También la define como un fenómeno grupal, y por lo tanto con funciones sociales. Peter Berger, en su libro Risa redentora (1997), declara no estar de acuerdo con el pensamiento de Bergson acerca del carácter social de la risa. En sus propias palabras: «esto es discutible, sin duda también existe la diversión solitaria». Incluso en la risa en soledad, siempre existe un elemento humano —o, al menos, de un ser vivo animado— directa o indirectamente relacionado con el suceso desencadenante. Un aspecto destacable de su pensamiento es que considera que lo cómico aparece cuando se reprimen otras emociones, como el odio, o la compasión. ",

  "premise": "In Laughter: An Essay on the Meaning of the Comic, French philosopher Henri Bergson, renowned for his philosophical studies on materiality, memory, life and consciousness, tries to determine the laws of the comic and to understand the fundamental causes of comic situations. His method consists in determining the causes of the comic instead of analyzing its effects. He also deals with laughter in relation to human life, collective imagination and art, to have a better knowledge of society. One of the theories of the essay is that laughter, as a collective activity, has a social and moral role, in forcing people to eliminate their vices. It is a factor of uniformity of behaviours, as it condemns ludicrous and eccentric behaviours. ",

Usó un nombre masculino para asegurar que su trabajo fuera tomado en serio. Pocas escritoras publicaban bajo sus nombres verdaderos, como el caso de Charlotte Brontë y sus hermanas.

Allí destacó en los deportes, especialmente rugby, golf y boxeo. En este período también trabajó en Aston (actual distrito de Birmingham) y Sheffield. . A principios de 1880 se embarcó, para ejercer como cirujano en sustitución de un amigo suyo, en un ballenero denominado The Hope que durante seis meses navegaría hacia el Ártico. . A los veintidós años de edad, en 1881, se graduó como médico y completó su doctorado sobre el Tabes dorsal en . Sin embargo, recibió el doctorado cuatro años después. Fue en estos años cuando hizo una gran amistad con el también escritor escocés J. M. Barrie.",

  "premise": "From 1876 to 1881, Doyle studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh Medical School; during this period he spent time working in Aston (then a town in Warwickshire, now part of Birmingham), Sheffield and Ruyton-XI-Towns, Shropshire. Also during this period, he studied practical botany at the Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh. While studying, Doyle began writing short stories. His earliest extant fiction, \"The Haunted Grange of Goresthorpe\", was unsuccessfully submitted to Blackwood's Magazine. His first published piece, \"The Mystery of Sasassa Valley\", a story set in South Africa, was printed in Chambers's Edinburgh Journal on 6 September 1879. On 20 September 1879, he published his first academic article, \"Gelsemium as a Poison\" in the British Medical Journal, a study which The Daily Telegraph regarded as potentially useful in a 21st-century murder investigation.",

Con ello, Peter cree haber matado a Marko y al comentarle a la tía May sobre la presunta muerte del Hombre de Arena a manos de Spider-Man, que si bien para Peter fue como vengar a su tío, ella le advierte que la venganza además de ser perjudicial para una persona, también envenena el alma y corrompe el corazón y que sin darse cuenta se convierte en alguien malo.",

Peter's changed comportment alienates Mary Jane, who is struggling in her career because of her show receiving negative reviews from critics. She shares a tender moment with Harry but leaves in regret. Urged by a hallucination of his father, Harry recovers from his amnesia and forces Mary Jane to break up with Peter. Peter she loves \"somebody else,\" Harry meets with Peter and claims to be that person. Under the influence of the symbiote, Peter later confronts Harry over this and, after a brief fight, spitefully tells him that his father never loved him.

  "text": "La \"utilidad\" se define de varias maneras, generalmente en términos del bienestar de los seres humanos. Bentham la describió como la suma de todo placer que resulta de una acción, menos el sufrimiento de cualquier persona involucrada en dicha acción. En la economía neoclásica, se llama utilidad a la satisfacción de preferencias, mientras que en la filosofía moral, es sinónimo de felicidad, sea cual sea el modo en el que esta se entienda. Esta doctrina ética a veces es resumida como \"el máximo bienestar para el máximo número\".",

  "premise": "The word utility is used to mean general well-being or happiness, and Mill's view is that utility is the consequence of a good action. Utility, within the context of utilitarianism, refers to people performing actions for social utility. With social utility, he means the well-being of many people. Mill's explanation of the concept of utility in his work, Utilitarianism, is that people really do desire happiness, and since each individual desires their own happiness, it must follow that all of us desire the happiness of everyone, contributing to a larger social utility. Thus, an action that results in the greatest pleasure for the utility of society is the best action, or as Jeremy Bentham, the founder of early Utilitarianism put it, as the greatest happiness of the greatest number.",

To exceed a self-sufficiency of 40% in a household equipped with photovoltaics, energy storage is needed. Multiple manufacturers produce rechargeable battery systems for storing energy, generally to hold surplus energy from home solar or wind generation.

Los síntomas principales son el dolor de garganta, un aumento leve de la temperatura corporal y ganglios linfáticos (nódulos linfáticos) inflamados en el cuello. Además, se puede formar una membrana en la garganta. Las lesiones de la piel pueden ser dolorosas, de aspecto hinchado y enrojecido. También se reconocen con menor frecuencia cuadros iniciales de infección cutánea, vaginal, de conjuntivas oculares u oídos. Los síntomas suelen aparecer a los 3 a 9 días. Si no aparecen antes o después, se debe acudir a un hospital entre 24 a 48 horas después del contagio.",

  "premise": "The symptoms of diphtheria usually begin two to seven days after infection. They include fever of 38 °C (100.4 °F) or above; chills; fatigue; bluish skin coloration (cyanosis); sore throat; hoarseness; cough; headache; difficulty swallowing; painful swallowing; difficulty breathing; rapid breathing; foul-smelling and bloodstained nasal discharge; and lymphadenopathy. Within two to three days, diphtheria may destroy healthy tissues in the respiratory system. The dead tissue forms a thick, gray coating that can build up in the throat or nose. This thick gray coating is called a \"pseudomembrane\". It can cover tissues in the nose, tonsils, voice box, and throat, making it very hard to breathe and swallow. Symptoms can also include cardiac arrhythmias, myocarditis, and cranial and peripheral nerve palsies.",

  "text": "La palabra optimismo y la importancia de creer en ti proviene del latín \"optimum\": \"lo mejor\". El término fue usado por primera vez para referirse a la doctrina sostenida por el filósofo alemán Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz en su obra Ensayos de Teodicea sobre la bondad de Dios, la libertad del hombre y el origen del mal (Ámsterdam, 1710), según la cual el mundo en el que vivimos es el mejor de los mundos posibles. Una postura parecida es sostenida con distintos matices por los filósofos William Godwin, Ralph Waldo Emerson y Friedrich Nietzsche. Por otra parte, el espíritu de algunos movimientos espirituales, como el Renacimiento y la Ilustración, fue identificado como optimista y lleno de fe en el hombre y sus posibilidades, frente a épocas opuestas y pesimistas como la Edad Media y el Barroco.",
  "pair_type": "en-es",
  "premise": "Distinct from a disposition to believe that things will work out, there is a philosophical idea that, perhaps in ways that may not be fully comprehended, the present moment is in an optimum state. This view that all of nature - past, present, and future - operates by laws of optimization along the lines of Hamilton's principle in the realm of physics is countered by views such as idealism, realism, and philosophical pessimism. Philosophers often link the concept of optimism with the name of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who held that we live in the best of all possible worlds (le meilleur des mondes possibles), or that God created a physical universe that applies the laws of physics. The concept was also reflected in an aspect of Francois-Marie Arouet de Voltaire's early philosophy, one that was based on Isaac Newton's view that described a divinely ordered human condition. This philosophy would also later emerge in Alexander Pope's Essay on Man.",

  "text": "Según Aristóteles ( ), Hegemón de Tasos fue el inventor de un tipo de parodia; alterando ligeramente la redacción de poemas conocidos, transformó lo sublime en ridículo. En la antigua literatura griega, una parodia era un poema narrativo que imitaba el estilo y la prosodia de la épicas \"pero que trataba temas ligeros, satíricos o burlón-heroicos\". En efecto, los componentes de la palabra griega son παρά para \"al lado, en contra, en contra\" y ᾠδή oide \"canto\". Así, la palabra griega original παρῳδία parodia se ha tomado a veces para significar \"contracanción\", una imitación que se contrapone al original. El Oxford English Dictionary, por ejemplo, define la parodia como la imitación \"vuelta como para producir un efecto ridículo\". Dado que par- también tiene el significado no antagónico de al lado, \"no hay nada en parodia que haga necesaria la inclusión de un concepto de ridiculez\".",
  "pair_type": "en-es",
  "premise": "5), Hegemon of Thasos was the inventor of a kind of parody; by slightly altering the wording in well-known poems he transformed the sublime into the ridiculous. In ancient Greek literature, a parodia was a narrative poem imitating the style and prosody of epics \"but treating light, satirical or mock-heroic subjects\". Indeed, the components of the Greek word are παρά para \"beside, counter, against\" and ᾠδή oide \"song\". Thus, the original Greek word παρῳδία parodia has sometimes been taken to mean \"counter-song\", an imitation that is set against the original. The Oxford English Dictionary, for example, defines parody as imitation \"turned as to produce a ridiculous effect\". Because par- also has the non-antagonistic meaning of beside, \"there is nothing in parodia to necessitate the inclusion of a concept of ridicule. ",

That may be true depending on the particular sentence, but to avoid repetition in this case, \"against\" could be translated just as \"contra\", as in \"against the wall\" (contra la pared). So, \"beside, counter, against\" could become \"al lado, en contra, contra\".\nThe word \"song\" is usually translated as \"canción\" (music with words) because \"canto\" refers to singing or to birdsong. This makes even more sense when \"countersong\" is translated as \"contracanción\", not \"contracanto\".\n\"vuelta\" does mean \"turned\" but in a more concrete way. I think \"transformed\" (transformed) would be more appropriate in this context.  ",

Japanese kanji usually have at least two ways of pronouncing them: one that comes from Chinese (onyomi) and one that comes from Japanese (kunyomi). If what the English version means by \"the Sino-Japanese reading of Chinese\" is onyomi (Chinese pronunciation), then it has a different meaning than the Spanish version, which is only referring to meaning.",

Los fisioterapeutas trabajan con atletas y personas activas para evaluar y tratar lesiones, así como para ayudar a prevenir futuras lesiones mediante la mejora de la fuerza, la flexibilidad y el equilibrio. Además, los fisioterapeutas pueden proporcionar una variedad de terapias, incluyendo masajes, ejercicios y terapia manual, para ayudar a aliviar el dolor y la inflamación, y para promover la curación y la rehabilitación de lesiones deportivas. La fisioterapia es una parte crucial de la medicina deportiva y puede ser esencial para ayudar a los atletas a recuperarse de lesiones y a mejorar su rendimiento deportivo.",

Nevertheless,  I'll label the paragraphs because there is a lot of overlapping if they are in fact talking about the same kind of professionals. \n\nFor the most part, EV describes what athletic trainers do in a neutral tone; it only uses the word \"key\", which matches the word \"esencial\" (essential) in SV.  Besides that, SV is emphatic in the importance of what they do with expressions such as: \n- typically (relating to frequency) / fundamental (fundamental) (relating to essence) \n- crucial (crucial) (used twice) with no corresponding span in EV\n\nathletic trainers (professionals, people) / la fisioterapia (physiotherapy or physical therapy) (major, academic field) \nEquivalence: therapeutic intervention / el tratamiento (the treatment)\nEquivalence: key to treatment and rehabilitation / esencial para ayudar a los atletas a recuperarse de lesions (essential for helping athletes recuperate from lesions)",

  "text": "Herāt se remonta a tiempos antiguos, pero su edad permanece desconocida. En tiempos del Imperio aqueménida (550-330 a. C.), los alrededores del distrito fueron conocidos como Haraiva (en persa antiguo), y según fuentes clásicas la región fue conocida como Aria (Areia). En el Avesta zoroastriano, la ciudad es mencionada como Haroiva. El nombre del distrito y su ciudad principal deriva del río principal de la región, el Hari Rud (antiguo persa harayu, ‘con velocidad’), el cual cruza el distrito y pasa justo al sur (5 km) de la moderna Herāt. El nombrar una región y su principal ciudad por su río principal es una característica muy común en esta parte del mundo.",

Under the Persian Achaemenid Empire (550–330 BC), the surrounding district was known by the Old Persian name of Haraiva (𐏃𐎼𐎡𐎺), and in classical sources, the region was correspondingly known as Areia (Aria). In the Zoroastrian collection of Avesta, the district is referred as Haroiva. The name of the district and its principal town is a derivative from that of the local river, the Herey River (from Old Iranian Harayu, meaning \"with velocity\"), which goes through the district and ends south of Herat. Herey is mentioned in Sanskrit as a yellow or golden color equivalent to Persian \"Zard\" meaning Gold (yellow). The naming of a region and its principal town after the main river is a common feature in this part of the world— compare the adjoining districts/rivers/towns of Arachosia and Bactria.",
