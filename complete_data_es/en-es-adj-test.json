  "text": "La pimienta pierde sabor y aroma si se deja al aire libre una vez recogida, por lo que el almacenaje hermético preserva su aroma y sabor durante más tiempo. Otra forma de que la pimienta pierda sabor es exponerla a la luz demasiado tiempo, ya que puede transformar la piperina en isochavicina (casi insípida). Una vez molida, los compuestos aromáticos de la pimienta pueden evaporarse rápidamente siendo por esto por lo que en las recetas culinarias se recomienda moler los granos de pimienta enteros inmediatamente antes de su uso. Para esto se usan los molinillos de pimienta que muelen o machacan los granos de pimienta enteros en vez de las pimenteras con pimienta ya molida. Los molinillos de pimienta han sido usados en las cocinas europeas desde el s. XIV, pero el mortero, usado antes de estos para machacar la pimienta, siguió siendo un método popular también durante siglos.",

  "premise": "Pepper loses flavour and aroma through evaporation, so airtight storage helps preserve its spiciness longer. Pepper can also lose flavour when exposed to light, which can transform piperine into nearly tasteless isochavicine. Once ground, pepper's aromatics can evaporate quickly; most culinary sources recommend grinding whole peppercorns immediately before use for this reason. Handheld pepper mills or grinders, which mechanically grind or crush whole peppercorns, are used for this as an alternative to pepper shakers that dispense ground pepper. Spice mills such as pepper mills were found in European kitchens as early as the 14th century, but the mortar and pestle used earlier for crushing pepper have remained a popular method for centuries, as well.",

This is the kind of situation where I struggle with connotation difference - like I know it's not the difference between thin and scrawny. They are very different ideas (spicy vs aroma and taste). However, they chose to insert this at the same point in the sentence and it modifies the idea. I can't really pick it as new information, because it is listed elsewhere. It's also not inferable.

Es más, Alpher y Herman pudieron estimar que la temperatura del fondo de radiación de microondas era 5 K, aunque dos años después, la reestimaron en 2.8 . Aunque había varias estimaciones previas de la temperatura del espacio (ver cronología), estas sufrieron dos defectos. En primer lugar, fueron medidas de la temperatura efectiva del espacio y no sugieren que el espacio fue rellenado con un espectro de Planck térmico. Y en segundo lugar, son dependientes de nuestro lugar especial en el extremo de la Vía Láctea y no sugieren que la radiación es isótropa.",
  "pair_type": "en-es",
  "premise": "Alpher and Herman were able to estimate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background to be 5 K, though two years later they re-estimated it at 28 K. This high estimate was due to a misestimate of the Hubble constant by Alfred Behr, which could not be replicated and was later abandoned for the earlier estimate. Although there were several previous estimates of the temperature of space, these estimates had two flaws. First, they were measurements of the temperature of space and did not suggest that space was filled with a thermal Planck spectrum. Next, they depend on our being at a special spot at the edge of the Milky Way galaxy and they did not suggest the radiation is isotropic. The estimates would yield very different predictions if Earth happened to be located elsewhere in the universe.",

  "text": "Los capilares de las vellosidades son ramas terminales de los vasos sanguíneos umbilicales. La sangre fetal desoxigenada llega por vía de las arterias umbilicales y sale de la placenta con sangre oxigenada por una sola vena, la vena umbilical. La presión sanguínea en la arteria umbilical es aproximadamente 50 mmHg y esta sangre fluye a través de vasos más delgados que cruzan la placa coriónica hasta los capilares que están dentro de las vellosidades, lugar donde la presión sanguínea cae a 30 mmHg. En la vena umbilical la presión es de 20 mmHg. La presión en los vasos fetales y sus ramas siempre es mayor que la de los espacios intervellosos. Ello protege a los vasos sanguíneos fetales de que sean colapsadas.",

  "premise": "Deoxygenated fetal blood passes through umbilical arteries to the placenta. At the junction of umbilical cord and placenta, the umbilical arteries branch radially to form chorionic arteries. Chorionic arteries, in turn, branch into cotyledon arteries. In the villi, these vessels eventually branch to form an extensive arterio-capillary-venous system, bringing the fetal blood extremely close to the maternal blood; but no intermingling of fetal and maternal blood occurs (\"placental barrier\").",

However, I listed it as new information because I don't think we can make these assumptions. If I did, I would start listing a lot more things as inferable. The next problematic sentence is the one about employment - in one it says 84,000 and the other 83,000. So, in theory they are both new information.

  "text": "El rico contenido en glúcidos del fruto del pan propició que varios personajes británicos como Joseph Banks extendiera el cultivo del árbol del pan por el Caribe y así disponer de un alimento altamente nutritivo y de fácil cultivo para los esclavos americanos de las Antillas. Por esta razón, en 1787 la Marina Real de Gran Bretaña ordenó la salida del HMAV Bounty, encargado de llegar hasta Tahití y obtener especímenes del árbol del pan y transportarlas al Caribe, donde iniciar su reproducción. El mando del navío recayó en William Bligh, que por su carácter duro y severo, y sus decisiones arbitrarias, logró empeorar las relaciones a bordo. El 26 de octubre de 1788 llegaron a Tahití, y se llevaron 1.015 ejemplares del árbol del pan. Cuando estalló el motín a la vuelta hacia Gran Bretaña, los amotinados lanzaron por la borda todos los ejemplares del árbol del pan, en señal de rebelión contra Bligh, más preocupado del cuidado de las plantas que de sus propios hombres.",

  "premise": "In 1769, Joseph Banks was stationed in Tahiti as part of the expedition commanded by Captain James Cook. The late-18th-century quest for cheap, high-energy food sources for slaves in British colonies prompted colonial administrators and plantation owners to call for breadfruit to be brought to the Caribbean. As president of the Royal Society, Banks provided a cash bounty and gold medal for success in this endeavor, and successfully lobbied for a British Naval expedition. After an unsuccessful voyage to the South Pacific to collect the plants as commander of , in 1791, William Bligh commanded a second expedition with and , which collected seedless breadfruit plants in Tahiti and transported these to St. Helena in the Atlantic and St. Vincent and Jamaica in the West Indies.",

  "text": "El teólogo del Agustín de Hipona escribió que el relato de la creación del Génesis no debería interpretarse literalmente. Como expone en su libro De Genesi ad litteram (\"Sobre la interpretación literal del Génesis\"), creía que en algunos casos las nuevas criaturas se formaban debido a la «descomposición» de formas de vida más primitivas. Para él, «plantas, aves de corral y animales no son perfectos... pero fueron creados en un estado de potencialidad». No obstante, consideraba teológicamente perfectos a los ángeles, al firmamento y al alma humana. Su idea de que los seres vivos se transformaban lentamente con el tiempo llevó a Giuseppe Tanzella-Nitti, profesor de teología de la Pontificia Universidad de la Santa Cruz, en Roma, a afirmar que Agustín había sugerido una forma de evolución.",
  "pair_type": "en-es",
  "premise": "In Augustine's De Genesi contra Manichæos, on Genesis he says: \"To suppose that God formed man from the dust with bodily hands is very childish. ...God neither formed man with bodily hands nor did he breathe upon him with throat and lips.\" Augustine suggests in other work his theory of the later development of insects out of carrion, and the adoption of the old emanation or evolution theory, showing that \"certain very small animals may not have been created on the fifth and sixth days, but may have originated later from putrefying matter.\" Concerning Augustine's De Trinitate (On the Trinity), White wrote that Augustine \"...develops at length the view that in the creation of living beings there was something like a growth—that God is the ultimate author, but works through secondary causes; and finally argues that certain substances are endowed by God with the power of producing certain classes of plants and animals.\"",

Tan solo se producen peleas durante la época de celo (variable según especies), que pueden llegar a ser hasta cierto punto cómicas en algunas especies. Las liebres europeas de sexo masculino apenas comen durante este período (primavera), y pasan el día luchando con sus rivales, golpeándose con las patas delanteras en una especie de “boxeo” ritual. En Inglaterra, el dicho popular Estás más loco que una liebre en marzo tiene su origen en esta conducta. Las hembras que no acceden a aparearse luchan, con los pretendientes a los que rechazan, de la misma manera en que estos se deshacen de sus oponentes.",

This appears to be competition between males to attain dominance for breeding. During this spring frenzy, animals of both sexes can be seen \"boxing\", one hare striking another with its paws. This behavior gives rise to the idiom \"mad as a March hare\". This is present not only in intermale competition, but also among females toward males to prevent copulation.",

One can be alone without necessarily being afraid of others, especially when the Spanish version immediately adds \"aunque no les importa en absoluto la presencia de otras liebres en los alrededores\" (even though they don't care at all about the presence of other hares around). \nThe English version presents boxing as one hare hitting another one, while the Spanish version presents an image of both hitting each other at the same time. \nAlthough put a little differently, I would consider the last sentence in Spanish as a paraphrase of the English one, so I'm not labeling them.

Close, but not the same.\nforehead (part of the face) / cara (face, implies the entire face)\n\"algunas marcas de facción más marcadas\" (literally, some marks of features more marked)  sounds weird in Spanish, since \"facción\", or better yet \"facciones\" (features), already refers to lines or shapes of the face. Plus, \"marcas\" (marks) and \"marcadas\" (marked) also seem redundant.  So, it would make more sense for SV to simply go: \"algunas facciones más marcadas\" (some more pronounced features). In any case, that span could correspond or be inferable from \"has a more curved forehead and sloping snout\", but I'm not sure if those are the features that the SV is referring to. ",

    "comment": "Population numbers are a little different: 227000 and 410000 in the English version v. 225000 and 400000 in the Spanish version.\nThe Spanish version uses the word \"se refugió\" (took refuge) while the English version uses the word \"fled\". \nI think there's an important typo in the Spanish version in \"al otro lado de la Bahía de Oakland\" (on the other side of Oakland Bay). As far as I know, there is no \"Oakland Bay\", but rather Oakland is located on the other side of the San Francisco Bay (taking San Francisco as the point of reference). The English version corroborates this with \"fled across the bay to Oakland and Berkeley\". \nAlso, correct me if I'm wrong, but the Panhandle is, at its core, a park, which makes sense because it's where the tents were located, the other two locations cited are also parks (Golden Gate and the Presidio), and its very name comes from forming a panhandle shape with Golden Gate Park.  In the Spanish version, it's called a neighborhood (\"barrio\") and it makes sense that the houses around the park get that name for real estate purposes, but for these paragraphs, I think it makes more sense to call it a park.

Uno de los fundadores del partido demócrata, Van Buren fue el noveno gobernador del estado de New York, el décimo Secretario de Estado de los Estados Unidos, y el octavo Vicepresidente de los Estados Unidos. Ganó las elecciones presidenciales de Estados Unidos de 1836 con el apoyo del presidente previo Andrew Jackson y la fuerte organización política del partido demócrata. Perdió la reelección del año 1840 a William Henry Harrison por causa de la pobre economía causada en gran parte por el pánico de 1837. Después en su vida llegó a ser una figura importante para la causa en contra de la esclavitud y apoyo al partido \"Free Soil Party\" (Partido de Tierra Libre) en 1848.",

  "premise": "Martin Van Buren ( December 5, 1782 – July 24, 1862) was an American lawyer and statesman who served as the eighth president of the United States from 1837 to 1841. A primary founder of the Democratic Party, he served as New York's attorney general, U.S. senator, then briefly as the ninth governor of New York before joining Andrew Jackson's administration as the tenth United States secretary of state, minister to the United Kingdom, and ultimately the eighth vice president when named Jackson's running mate for the 1832 election. Van Buren won the presidency in 1836, lost re-election in 1840, and failed to win the Democratic nomination in 1844. Later in his life, Van Buren emerged as an elder statesman and an important anti-slavery leader who led the Free Soil Party ticket in the 1848 presidential election.",

So, maybe I should highlight the part of the sentence that starts \"Escrituras filosoficas como la Republica de Platon\" as new information.

That's how I'm reconciling both versions.   ",

Neo takes the red pill, and his reality begins to distort, awakening in a liquid-filled pod among countless other pods, containing other humans. He is then brought aboard Morpheus's flying ship, the Nebuchadnezzar. As Neo recuperates from a lifetime of physical inactivity in the pod, Morpheus explains the situation: In the early 21st century, a war broke out between humanity and intelligent machines. After humans blocked the machines' access to solar energy, the machines responded by enslaving humankind and harvesting their bioelectric power while keeping their minds pacified in the Matrix, a shared simulated reality modeled on the world as it was in 1999. In the years following, the remaining free humans took refuge in the underground city of Zion.",

  "text": "Para transcribir una consonante sola o seguida por otra consonante se elige el carácter que equivalga al valor de la consonante + u. Esto es así porque en japonés la u se pronuncia débilmente. Sin embargo, como tu y du no existen en japonés, la t y la d sueltas se transcriben como to y do, respectivamente. Ejemplos: キス (kisu, del inglés kiss: beso) y ヒント (hinto, del inglés hint: pista). Si esa consonante se pronuncia de modo brusco o acentuado, en katakana se convierte en consonante doble. Ejemplo: ベッド (beddo, del inglés bed: cama). Esto produce que, para palabras que tengan una sílaba con 'u' se doblen. Los sonidos que no existen en japonés se sustituyen por los que les sean afines.",
  "pair_type": "en-es",
  "premise": "A character called a sokuon, which is visually identical to a small tsu ッ, indicates that the following consonant is geminated (doubled). This is represented in rōmaji by doubling the consonant that follows the sokuon. In Japanese this is an important distinction in pronunciation; for example, compare サカ saka \"hill\" with サッカ sakka \"author\". Geminated consonants are common in transliterations of foreign loanwords; for example, English \"bed\" is represented as ベッド (beddo). The sokuon also sometimes appears at the end of utterances, where it denotes a glottal stop. However, it cannot be used to double the na, ni, nu, ne, no syllables' consonants; to double these, the singular n (ン) is added in front of the syllable. The sokuon may also be used to approximate a non-native sound: Bach is written (Bahha); Mach as (Mahha).",

  "text": "Se le considera uno de los precursores del liberalismo y fue quien elaboró la teoría de la separación de poderes. La teoría sobre la división de poderes encontró en Montesquieu a su máximo exponente, desarrollando este una célebre tesis que serviría como modelo y punto de partida a los gobernantes posteriores de los siglos y , aunque su teoría no sea la única realizada para tratar el tema. La estructura que presenta Montesquieu sobre la división de poderes está influenciada por la práctica constitucionalista británica donde existen sistemas de frenos, contrapesos y controles que esta utiliza según un modelo racionalista. Montesquieu atribuye al Parlamento el poder legislativo con la sanción real de la ley, el ejecutivo al gobierno, y el judicial a los tribunales de justicia.",
  "pair_type": "en-es",
  "premise": "Montesquieu's most influential work divided French society into three classes (or trias politica, a term he coined): the monarchy, the aristocracy, and the commons. Montesquieu saw two types of governmental power existing: the sovereign and the administrative. The administrative powers were the executive, the legislative, and the judicial. These should be separate from and dependent upon each other so that the influence of any one power would not be able to exceed that of the other two, either singly or in combination. This was a radical idea because it does not follow the three Estates structure of the French Monarchy: the clergy, the aristocracy, and the people at large represented by the Estates-General, thereby erasing the last vestige of a feudalistic structure.",

It would be much clearer if \"Siendo una cavity\" (being a cavity\") were removed and just leave \"es un embudo osteomuscular\" (is a musculoskeletal funnel).",

During the same year, he dedicated time and effort in joining the Forum Against Islamophobia and Racism, an organisation that worked towards battling misconceptions and acts against others because of their religious beliefs or their racial identity (or both), after many Muslims reported a backlash against them due in part to the grief caused by the events in the United States on 11 September.",

La idea se remonta a cuando el director, Andrew Stanton, era un niño; le gustaba ir al dentista a ver la pecera y asumió que los peces eran del océano y querían volver a casa. En 1992, poco después de que su hijo naciera, él y su familia viajaron al Six Flags Discovery Kingdom (que se llamaba Marine World en aquella época), donde sintió que el mundo submarino podría realizarse hermosamente mediante animación por ordenador. Más tarde, en 1997, mientras daba con su hijo un paseo por el parque, se dio cuenta de que lo sobreprotegía constantemente y que había perdido una oportunidad de tener «experiencias padre-hijo» aquel día. En una entrevista con la revista National Geographic, declaró que la idea para los personajes de Marlin y Nemo vino de una fotografía de dos peces payaso saliendo de una anémona:",

  "premise": "The inspiration for Finding Nemo sprang from multiple experiences, going back to director Andrew Stanton's childhood, when he loved going to the dentist to see the fish tank, assuming that the fish were from the ocean and wanted to go home. In 1992, shortly after his son was born, he and his family took a trip to Six Flags Discovery Kingdom (which was called Marine World at the time). There, after seeing the shark tube and various exhibits, he felt that the underwater world could be done beautifully in computer animation. Later, in 1997, he took his son for a walk in the park but realized that he was overprotecting him and lost an opportunity to have a father-son experience that day.",

La poesía es disociada de la música, pero la musicalidad es creada en la escritura misma del poema. En efecto, la balada tiene la particularidad de repetir un mismo verso, estribillo, al final de cada tres estrofas. Está constituida por octosílabas y las rimas están cruzadas. Como regla, la balada medieval empieza siempre con la palabra Príncipe. Aunque no hay que confundir la balada romántica en la poesía.",

  "premise": "A ballad is a form of verse, often a narrative set to music. Ballads derive from the medieval French chanson balladée or ballade, which were originally \"dance songs\". Ballads were particularly characteristic of the popular poetry and song of Britain and Ireland from the Late Middle Ages until the 19th century. They were widely used across Europe, and later in Australia, North Africa, North America and South America.",

Fue nombrado por Clinton Hart Merriam en 1898 en honor del presidente, Theodore Roosevelt, cazador y naturalista aficionado. Muy parecido al ciervo de las Montañas Rocosas, el uapití de Roosevelt se diferencia de éste por su mayor tamaño (los machos suelen rondar los 450 kg) y pelaje más oscuro. Las astas poseen numerosas puntas y sus extremos pueden aparecer ligeramente palmeados.",

Este grupo constituye alrededor del 10 % de toda la población con discapacidad cognitiva. Adquieren habilidades de comunicación durante los primeros años de la niñez. Adquieren una formación laboral y, con supervisión moderada, pueden adquirir destrezas para su propio cuidado personal. También pueden beneficiarse de adiestramiento en habilidades sociales y laborales, pero es improbable que progresen más allá de un segundo nivel en materias escolares. Pueden aprender a trasladarse independientemente por lugares que les son familiares.

People with moderate intellectual disabilities need considerable supports in school, at home, and in the community in order to fully participate. While their academic potential is limited, they can learn simple health and safety skills and to participate in simple activities. As adults, they may live with their parents, in a supportive group home, or even semi-independently with significant supportive services to help them, for example, manage their finances. As adults, they may work in a sheltered workshop. About 10% of persons with ID are likely to have moderate ID.",

Hamm decided not to use an origin story, feeling that flashbacks would be more suitable and that \"unlocking the mystery\" would become part of the storyline.

He completed his script in October 1986, which demoted Dick Grayson to a cameo rather than a supporting character. One scene in Hamm's script had a young James Gordon on duty the night of the murder of Bruce Wayne's parents.

Ichiro recorded 50 hits in four different months of the year (September and October are combined by MLB for this computational purpose), becoming the first player ever to have four in a season.

However, I'm apprehensive about labeling it like that because referring to the whole history of a sport that is played in many countries (I'm guessing they're talking about baseball) sounds like quite the statement as opposed to specifically breaking someone's record (and I don't know anything about baseball). Also, the numbers don't match exactly (the Spanish version counts 262 hits).\nPete Rose is compared with Ichiro in both versions, but the record that is highlighted around him is not quite the same.

  "text": "Garfield es un gato gordo anaranjado, con rayas negras y una peculiar forma de actuar. Tiene aproximadamente 7 años (es un British Shorthair Red y no un gato persa). Le encanta comer, dormir (ambas acciones en cantidades asombrosas), ver la televisión y burlarse de Jon y Odie. Su comida favorita es la lasaña, y detesta las pasas y las espinacas. Se le ha visto cazar pájaros, pero no ratones, pues considera asqueroso comerlos. También odia a las arañas y, sobre todo, los lunes (no aplicable cuando es su cumpleaños).",

  "premise": "Many of the gags focus on Garfield's obsessive eating and obesity; his dislike of spiders; his hatred of Mondays, diets, and any form of exertion; his constant shedding (which annoys Jon); and his abuse of Odie and Jon as well as his obsession with mailing Nermal to Abu Dhabi, or simply throwing him through the front door. Though he will eat nearly anything (with the exception of raisins and spinach), Garfield is particularly fond of lasagna; he also enjoys eating Jon's houseplants and other pets (mainly birds and fish).",

    "comment": "The Spanish version says \"Le encanta comer\" (he loves eating), which speaks about pleasure in that action, while the English version uses the expression \"obsessive eating\" and I don't think there's much pleasure in doing something obsessively.  \nThe Spanish version uses the word \"burlarse\" (making fun of), while the English version uses the word \"abuse\", which is not in good fun. \nThe Spanish version uses the expression \"Su comida favorita es la lasaña\" (his favorite food is lasagna), while the English version uses the expression \"is particularly fond of lasagna\", which doesn't necessarily place lasagna as number one.  \nThe Spanish version uses the word \"detesta las pasas y las espinacas\" (hates raisins and spinach), while the English version says \"he will eat nearly anything (with the exception of raisins and spinach)\", which doesn't really speak about his feelings on them or, even if it's inferable that he doesn't like them, at least it doesn't sound as harsh. \nThe Spanish version states \"Se le ha visto cazar pájaros, pero no ratones, pues considera asqueroso comerlos\" (he has been seen hunting birds, but not mice, since he considers them gross to eat), so it's inferable that he hunts birds in order to eat them and that would usually mean it's because he enjoys it, as the English version states, so I'm labeling it \"Inferable\" (even though sometimes animals hunt others without eating them).\nThe Spanish version states \"odia a las arañas\" (he hates spiders), which seems like a stronger word than \"dislike of spiders\" in the English version. However, the degree of dislike/hatred is maintained across versions because the Spanish version continues with \"odia a las arañas y, sobre todo, los lunes\" (he hates spiders and, above all, Mondays) and the English version continues with \"his dislike of spiders, his hatred of Mondays\". I would change the Spanish version to \"le desagradan las arañas\" to be more accurate to the English version.   ",

  "text": "Von Stephanitz buscó de forma primordial el aspecto práctico y de trabajo de la raza. Desde el principio, la forma en el pastor alemán no debería desviarle de su funcionalidad zootécnica. Von Stephanitz previó una primera amenaza a la validez de la raza como animal de trabajo cuando la sociedad humana se transformó de una base principalmente agrícola y ganadera a una economía industrializada. En una primera fase, persuadió al Gobierno alemán para que aceptara a la raza en trabajos de policía. Este fue el principio de la asociación de la raza con las fuerzas de la ley y con la utilización militar. Pronto las cualidades de inteligencia, fiabilidad y resistencia del animal, los aspectos principales de su carácter y su existencia en la historia, le garantizaron su utilización en muchos papeles importantes, siendo uno de esos papeles más nobles como perro guía para los ciegos.",

  "premise": "With the rise of large, industrialised cities in Germany, the predator population began to decline, rendering sheepdogs unnecessary. At the same time, the awareness of sheepdogs as a versatile, intelligent class of canine began to rise. Max von Stephanitz, an ex-cavalry captain and former student of the Berlin Veterinary College, was an ex-member of the Phylax Society who firmly believed dogs should be bred for working. He admired the intelligence, strength and ability of Germany's native sheepdogs, but could not find any one single breed that satisfied him as the perfect working dog.",

Este tipo de impresión se aplicó a obras cortas profusamente ilustradas y con grandes querencias, los superventas de la época y con muchas versiones diferentes: los más comunes fueron el Ars Moriendi y la Biblia pauperum.
