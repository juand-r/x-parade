  "text": "In women of childbearing age, use of antiepileptic drugs is a major concern balancing possible side effects on the fetus against risk from uncontrolled seizures. Use of AEDs entail teratogenic effects including intrauterine growth retardation, major congenital malformations, and developmental (neurocognitive) and behavioral issues, that need to be discussed with the patient at the time of starting the AEDs and before they plan pregnancy. Most women with epilepsy receive safe and effective treatment and have normal children, however, risks exist. The International League Against Epilepsy created a task force on women and epilepsy which published consensus recommendations to guide therapy decisions until more definitive evidence is available in the future.",

Los fármacos no se deben interrumpir, sin embargo, se aconseja que se utilice un único fármaco antiepiléptico y que se use en la mínima dosis posible, estudios indican que algunos antiepilépticos pueden provocar malformaciones de distinto tipo además de nacer con un menor coeficiente intelectual. Sin embargo, es importante subrayar que un embarazo con una epilepsia descontrolada es mucho peor para la madre y el feto.",

  "premise": "Apolo 11 fue la quinta misión tripulada del Programa Apolo de los Estados Unidos y la primera de la historia en lograr que un ser humano llegara a la Luna. La nave Apolo de la misión se envió al espacio el 16 de julio de 1969, realizó su alunizaje el 20 de julio de ese mismo año y al día siguiente dos astronautas (Armstrong y Aldrin) se convirtieron en los primeros en caminar sobre la superficie lunar. El Apolo11 fue impulsado por un cohete Saturno V desde la plataforma LC 39A y lanzado a las 13:32 UTC del complejo de cabo Kennedy, en Florida (EE. UU.). Oficialmente se conoció a la misión como AS-506. La misión fue un hito decisivo de la NASA contra el programa espacial de la Unión Soviética durante la carrera espacial y está considerada como uno de los momentos más significativos en la historia de la humanidad.",

  "text": "In the early 1800s, French psychiatrist Jean-Étienne Dominique Esquirol's lypemania, one of his affective monomanias, was the first elaboration on what was to become modern depression. The basis of the current conceptualization of bipolar illness can be traced back to the 1850s. In 1850, Jean-Pierre Falret described \"circular insanity\" (la folie circulaire, ); the lecture was summarized in 1851 in the \"Gazette des hôpitaux\" (\"Hospital Gazette\"). Three years later, in 1854, Jules-Gabriel-François Baillarger (1809–1890) described to the French Imperial Académie Nationale de Médecine a biphasic mental illness causing recurrent oscillations between mania and melancholia, which he termed folie à double forme (, \"madness in double form\"). Baillarger's original paper, \"De la folie à double forme,\" appeared in the medical journal Annales médico-psychologiques (Medico-psychological annals) in 1854.",
  "pair_type": "es-en",
  "premise": "La conceptualización psiquiátrica contemporánea de la enfermedad maníaco-depresiva es usualmente fechada cerca de 1850. El 31 de enero de 1854, Jules Baillarger describió a la Academia de Medicina del Imperio Francés una enfermedad mental de dos fases que causa oscilaciones entre la manía y la depresión. Dos semanas después, el 14 de febrero, Jean-Pierre Falret presentó una descripción a la Academia de lo que era esencialmente el mismo trastorno. Esta enfermedad fue designada como folie circulaire (locura circular) por Falret, y como folie à double forme (locura de forma dual) por Baillarger .",

The difference between the 7p1/2 and 7p3/2 levels is abnormally high; 9.8 eV. Astatine's 6p subshell split is only 3.8 eV, and its 6p1/2 chemistry has already been called \"limited\".

At the time of birth, the scales are soft and white. After several days, they harden and darken to resemble those of an adult pangolin. During the vulnerable stage, the mother stays with her offspring in the burrow, nursing it, and wraps her body around it if she senses danger. The young cling to the mother's tail as she moves about, although, in burrowing species, they remain in the burrow for the first 2–4 weeks of life. At one month, they first leave the burrow riding on the mother's back. Weaning takes place around 3 months of age, when the young begin to eat insects in addition to nursing. At 2 years of age, the offspring are sexually mature and are abandoned by the mother.",

Maurice did not become an actor, but worked for most of his life as a manager and agent for various theatres and performers, frequently managing his mother's career in her later years, but rarely with great success. Maurice and his family were usually financially dependent, in full or in part, on his mother until her death. Maurice married a Polish princess, Maria Jablonowska, of the House of Jablonowski, with whom he had two daughters: Simone, who married Edgar Gross, son of a wealthy Philadelphia soap manufacturer; and Lysiana, who married the playwright Louis Verneuil.",

  "premise": "Ese mismo año conoció a uno de los grandes amores de su vida, Charles-Joseph Lamoral, príncipe de Ligne. Inició una apasionada relación con él, hasta que quedó embarazada y el príncipe la abandonó. El 22 de diciembre de 1864 dio a luz a su único hijo, Maurice Bernhardt. Sin oficio y habiendo fracasado momentáneamente en el mundo del teatro, siguió los pasos de su madre, convirtiéndose en prostituta de lujo. Sarah no abandonó su actividad como cortesana hasta que su carrera teatral se hubo afianzado con éxito y pudo mantenerse solo con el trabajo que le reportaba el teatro.",

    "comment": "I guess \"had an affair with\" and \"Inició una apasionada relación con\" (Started a passionate relationship with\") could be equivalent, but not necessarily. An affair could refer to a single sexual encounter and still bring a child into the world. Also, if the word affair is used to mean that there was infidelity from one or both parties involved, a passionate relationship doesn't necessarily imply it. ",

On the other hand, some in the Chinese diaspora use the term \"Lunar New Year\", while \"Chinese New Year\" remains a popular and convenient translation for people of non-Chinese cultural backgrounds. Along with the Han Chinese in and outside Greater China, as many as 29 of the 55 ethnic minority groups in China also celebrate Chinese New Year. Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines celebrate it as an official festival.",

  "text": "The Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus stood on the Capitoline Hill in Rome. Jupiter was worshiped there as an individual deity, and with Juno and Minerva as part of the Capitoline Triad. The building was supposedly begun by king Tarquinius Priscus, completed by the last king (Tarquinius Superbus) and inaugurated in the early days of the Roman Republic (September 13, 509 BC). It was topped with the statues of four horses drawing a quadriga, with Jupiter as charioteer. A large statue of Jupiter stood within; on festival days, its face was painted red. In (or near) this temple was the Iuppiter Lapis: the Jupiter Stone, on which oaths could be sworn.",

C.). Se erigía sobre un podium alto con una escalinata de entrada en su frente. En tres de sus lados estaba probablemente flanqueado por una columnata y tenía otras dos filas de pilares dispuestos en línea con las de la fachada para formar un profundo pronao que precedía los tres cellae que iban de lado a lado a la manera etrusca, siendo la central más ancha que las otras dos.",

The only sacraments celebrated during this time are Baptism (for those in danger of death), Penance, and Anointing of the Sick.

En su lugar, se celebra la \"Liturgia de la Pasión del Señor\" a media tarde del viernes, a las 15:00, hora en la que se ha situado la muerte de Jesús en la cruz. Por razones pastorales puede anticiparse o celebrarse más tarde, aunque en ningún caso la celebración puede comenzar antes de las 12:00 ni concluir pasadas las 21:00. Los únicos sacramentos que se celebran durante este tiempo son el bautismo (en caso de peligro de muerte), la penitencia y la unción de enfermos. ",

It is connected to the Black Sea by the Strait of Kerch, which at its narrowest has a width of and a maximum depth of . The narrowness of the Kerch Strait limits the water exchange with the Black Sea. As a result, the salinity of the Sea of Azov is low; in the open sea it is 10–12 psu, about one third of the salinity of the oceans; it is even lower (2–7 psu) in the Taganrog Bay at the northeast end of the Sea.

La corriente predominante es un tipo de remolino que se mueve en el sentido contrario a las agujas del reloj. En invierno puede pasar que una buena parte del mar se hiele. El nivel del agua del mar de Azov varía mucho, dependiendo del viento y del agua de los ríos que desembocan en él.

  "text": "Starting in the 1950s, many species have been introduced to Lake Victoria where they have become invasive and a prime reason for the extinction of many endemic haplochromine cichlids. Among the introductions are several tilapias: redbreast (Coptodon rendalli), redbelly (C. zillii), Nile (Oreochromis niloticus) and blue-spotted tilapias (O. leucostictus). . Although these have contributed to the extinction of native fish by causing significant changes to the ecosystem, outcompeted natives and (in the case of the Nile tilapia) possibly hybridized with the highly threatened native tilapias, the most infamous introduction was the large and highly predatory Nile perch (Lates niloticus).",

  "premise": "Desde la introducción de la perca del Nilo (Lates niloticus) en la década de 1960, más de doscientas especies endémicas de Haplochromis, además de otras especies, han desaparecido y otras están en grave peligro. La perca del Nilo, pez de gran tamaño y de enorme voracidad, acabó de esta forma con la fuente de pesca tradicional de los habitantes de las orillas de lago durante miles de años. Sin embargo, no se puede achacar sólo a la depredación de la perca del Nilo la desaparición de la biodiversidad del lago, sino a una combinación con la eutrofización del lago, con la consecuente disminución en la concentración de oxígeno disuelto en el agua, y la pérdida de hábitat natural.",

EV highlights the responsibility of the perch, while SV is taking away from it. \n\"many endemic\" is inferable from SV's \"más de doscientas especies endémicas\" (more than two hundred endemic species). Although, one could argue that \"many\", in this case, is an understatement (connotation difference?)\n highly predatory / enorme voracidad (huge voracity/voraciousness): I think they're equivalent in this context, but not necessarily in general terms (perhaps in another situation one could think of an animal with a huge appetite that is not very effective at preying).

It was established in 1936 with legacies from the pharmaceutical magnate Henry Wellcome (founder of one of the predecessors of GlaxoSmithKline) to fund research to improve human and animal health. The aim of the Trust is to \"support science to solve the urgent health challenges facing everyone.\" It had a financial endowment of £29.1 billion in 2020, making it the fourth wealthiest charitable foundation in the world. In 2012, the Wellcome Trust was described by the Financial Times as the United Kingdom's largest provider of non-governmental funding for scientific research, and one of the largest providers in the world. According to their annual report, the Wellcome Trust spent GBP £1.1Bn on charitable activities across their 2019/2020 financial year. According to the OECD, the Wellcome Trust's financing for 2019 development increased by 22% to US$327 million.",

  "text": "Most of the major sources on Pythagoras's life are from the Roman period, by which point, according to the German classicist Walter Burkert, \"the history of Pythagoreanism was already... the laborious reconstruction of something lost and gone.\" Three ancient biographies of Pythagoras have survived from late antiquity, all of which are filled primarily with myths and legends. The earliest and most respectable of these is the one from Diogenes Laërtius's Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers. The two later biographies were written by the Neoplatonist philosophers Porphyry and Iamblichus and were partially intended as polemics against the rise of Christianity. The later sources are much lengthier than the earlier ones, and even more fantastic in their descriptions of Pythagoras's achievements. Porphyry and Iamblichus used material from the lost writings of Aristotle's disciples and material taken from these sources is generally considered to be the most reliable.",

Diógenes Laercio (ca. 200-250) y Porfirio (ca. 234-305) escribieron dos Vidas de Pitágoras, y Jámblico (ca. 245-325) Sobre la vida pitagórica. Estas biografías son, con algunas excepciones,Jenófanes, Heráclito, Heródoto, Platón, Aristóteles e Isócrates. Pertenecen a una época en que la figura de Pitágoras era vista de modo distorsionado y se basan, a su vez, en fuentes extraviadas, algunas de las cuales son de marcada tendencia neopitagórica y deliberadamente orientadas a ensalzar a Pitágoras, presentándolo como el origen de toda la verdad filosófica, cuyas ideas habrían sido plagiadas por Platón, Aristóteles y todos los filósofos posteriores.",

In his last days, he spoke and wrote about dying. Renouncing his aristocratic lifestyle, he left home one winter night. His secretive departure was an apparent attempt to escape from his wife's tirades. She spoke out against many of his teachings, and in recent years had grown envious of his attention to Tolstoyan \"disciples\".",

Murió de una neumonía . en la estación ferroviaria de Astápovo (actualmente, Lev Tolstói en la óblast de Lípetsk), después de caer enfermo cuando abandonó su casa a mediados de invierno. Su muerte llegó luego de huir del estilo de vida aristocrático y separarse de su esposa. Tolstói había intentado renunciar a sus propiedades en favor de los pobres, aunque su familia, en especial su esposa, Sofía Behrs, lo impidió. Este fue uno de los motivos por los que Tolstói había decidido abandonar su hogar.",

En la misma, Jackson explora las fuerzas culturales y económicas que lo llevaron a vender cocaína y crack, los detalles de su actividad empresarial como un narcotraficante y luego como rapero, y reflexiona sobre su propio carácter y en la sociedad. El 4 de enero de 2007, Jackson lanzó su imprenta G-Unit Books en el edificio de Time Warner. También coescribió The Ski Mask Way, una novela sobre un pequeño traficante de drogas que intenta robar a sus empleadores, la cual se convirtió en una película. Jackson dijo que leyó The 33 Strategies of War de Robert Greene, y trabajó con el autor en un libro titulado The 50th Law, una toma urbana de Las 48 leyes del poder. En mayo de 2008, Jackson se unió al multimillonario Patrice Motsepe para forjar una sociedad conjunta de venta de 50 Cent-platino de marca.",

Sus ideas al respecto fueron recogidas en 1866 en su Generelle Morphologie der Organismen (Morfología general de los organismos), cuyo segundo volumen dedicó a Charles Darwin, Wolfgang Goethe y Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. No obstante, aunque Haeckel fue un gran defensor de la idea de selección natural, en realidad ignoró el papel del azar en la teoría darwinista. Su evolucionismo aceptaba muchas de las ideas de Lamarck y la Naturphilosophie. Radicalmente progresista, Haeckel defendió que la evolución estaba dirigida hacia una complejización progresiva que tendría al hombre como meta última. Haeckel era, además, radicalmente materialista y monista y consideró la evolución como una de las mejores pruebas de dicha filosofía.",

En 1822, con la independencia, pasó a pertenecer a Brasil, pero sus fronteras con los países de habla hispana no estaban definidas antes del Tratado Vásquez Cobo-Martins, que reconoció las posesiones brasileñas en el norte del estado de Amazonas.",

In Grévy's zebras, young stay in \"kindergartens\" when their mothers leave for water. These groups are tended to by the territorial male. A stallion may look after a foal in his territory to ensure that the mother stays, though it may not be his. By contrast, plains zebra stallions are generally intolerant of foals that are not theirs and may practice infanticide and feticide via violence to the pregnant mare.",

En cambio, los potros de cebra de Grévy sólo tienen a su madre como protectora habitual, pues, como se ha dicho más arriba, los grupos de esta especie se suelen dispersar después de unos cuantos meses. La protección de los potros es especialmente relevante para estos animales, pues las crías son una presa fácil para los predadores y la mitad de ellas no sobreviven al primer año de vida a pesar de los esfuerzos de su madre y del macho del grupo. Otro de los peligros que corren los potros es que se han observado infanticidios y feticidios entre las cebras, a pesar de que únicamente se ha observado este comportamiento en ejemplares en cautividad.",

Plains zebras happen to be the most common type of zebra, so in this context, those words are indeed equivalent, but a person reading this wouldn't necessarily know that, so I'm labeling them as New Info. \nThe way the sentence is constructed \"protegidos\" (protected) seems to be in lieu of both EV's \"cared\" and \"protect\".\nThere's some sort of equivalence between \"the entire group works together to protect all the young\" and \"así como por el macho y las otras yeguas del grupo\" (as well as by the male and the other females of the group). However, one wouldn't necessarily know from EV the makeup of the group (how many males, how many females) or from SV that the entire group is involved.\nContradictory info: \"los potros de cebra de Grévy sólo tienen a su madre como protectora habitual\" (the Grévy's zebras' foals only have their mother as their usual protector) /  In Grévy's zebras, young stay in \"kindergartens\" when their mothers leave for water.

Their relationship was extensively publicized, with tabloids referring to the couple as Bennifer, the first celebrity portmanteau of its kind. They appeared together in the music video for her song \"Jenny from the Block\" and the film Jersey Girl. Then was dedicated to and inspired by Affleck.

También trabajaron en Jersey Girl (2004) y en el videoclip de «Jenny from the Block». Su relación, la cual fue apodada «Bennifer» y considerada como una superpareja, atrajo una atención masiva por parte de los medios y se generaron una gran cantidad de rumores sobre aspectos personales de ambos. La pareja se comprometió en noviembre de 2002 y tenían una boda prevista para el 14 de septiembre de 2003, pero fue pospuesta apenas cuatro días antes del evento a causa del acoso de los paparazzi. Finalmente se separaron en enero de 2004 en buenos términos. Lopez atribuyó la separación a la incomodidad de Affleck por el acoso de los medios y describió lo acontecido como «su primera ruptura amorosa verdadera».",

  "text": "In Laughter: An Essay on the Meaning of the Comic, French philosopher Henri Bergson, renowned for his philosophical studies on materiality, memory, life and consciousness, tries to determine the laws of the comic and to understand the fundamental causes of comic situations. His method consists in determining the causes of the comic instead of analyzing its effects. He also deals with laughter in relation to human life, collective imagination and art, to have a better knowledge of society. One of the theories of the essay is that laughter, as a collective activity, has a social and moral role, in forcing people to eliminate their vices. It is a factor of uniformity of behaviours, as it condemns ludicrous and eccentric behaviours. ",

  "premise": "A finales del , Henri Bergson reconoció la risa como fundamentalmente social. Define la risa como un fenómeno exclusivamente humano: aunque otros animales pueden manifestar síntomas parecidos a la risa, solo los seres humanos ríen de verdad. También la define como un fenómeno grupal, y por lo tanto con funciones sociales. Peter Berger, en su libro Risa redentora (1997), declara no estar de acuerdo con el pensamiento de Bergson acerca del carácter social de la risa. En sus propias palabras: «esto es discutible, sin duda también existe la diversión solitaria». Incluso en la risa en soledad, siempre existe un elemento humano —o, al menos, de un ser vivo animado— directa o indirectamente relacionado con el suceso desencadenante. Un aspecto destacable de su pensamiento es que considera que lo cómico aparece cuando se reprimen otras emociones, como el odio, o la compasión. ",

The other side of the spleen is divided by a ridge into two regions: an anterior gastric portion, and a posterior renal portion. The gastric surface is directed forward, upward, and toward the middle, is broad and concave, and is in contact with the posterior wall of the stomach. Below this it is in contact with the tail of the pancreas. The renal surface is directed medialward and downward. It is somewhat flattened, considerably narrower than the gastric surface, and is in relation with the upper part of the anterior surface of the left kidney and occasionally with the left adrenal gland.",

  "text": "From 1876 to 1881, Doyle studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh Medical School; during this period he spent time working in Aston (then a town in Warwickshire, now part of Birmingham), Sheffield and Ruyton-XI-Towns, Shropshire. Also during this period, he studied practical botany at the Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh. While studying, Doyle began writing short stories. His earliest extant fiction, \"The Haunted Grange of Goresthorpe\", was unsuccessfully submitted to Blackwood's Magazine. His first published piece, \"The Mystery of Sasassa Valley\", a story set in South Africa, was printed in Chambers's Edinburgh Journal on 6 September 1879. On 20 September 1879, he published his first academic article, \"Gelsemium as a Poison\" in the British Medical Journal, a study which The Daily Telegraph regarded as potentially useful in a 21st-century murder investigation.",

  "premise": "En 1876, comenzó la carrera de Medicina en la Universidad de Edimburgo, donde conoció al médico forense Joseph Bell, este profesor le inspiraría la figura de su famoso personaje, Sherlock Holmes. Allí destacó en los deportes, especialmente rugby, golf y boxeo. En este período también trabajó en Aston (actual distrito de Birmingham) y Sheffield. . A principios de 1880 se embarcó, para ejercer como cirujano en sustitución de un amigo suyo, en un ballenero denominado The Hope que durante seis meses navegaría hacia el Ártico. . A los veintidós años de edad, en 1881, se graduó como médico y completó su doctorado sobre el Tabes dorsal en . Sin embargo, recibió el doctorado cuatro años después. Fue en estos años cuando hizo una gran amistad con el también escritor escocés J. M. Barrie.",

However, one might stop studying something and not necessarily because one graduated, so the SV is more precise in this matter.",

Peter's changed comportment alienates Mary Jane, who is struggling in her career because of her show receiving negative reviews from critics. She shares a tender moment with Harry but leaves in regret. Urged by a hallucination of his father, Harry recovers from his amnesia and forces Mary Jane to break up with Peter. Peter she loves \"somebody else,\" Harry meets with Peter and claims to be that person. Under the influence of the symbiote, Peter later confronts Harry over this and, after a brief fight, spitefully tells him that his father never loved him. As Peter leaves, Harry throws a pumpkin bomb at him, who deflects it back, disfiguring Harry's face.",

Usando el nuevo traje, Peter localiza al Hombre de Arena, lucha contra él en un cavernoso túnel subterráneo del metro y, al descubrir que el agua puede disolver el cuerpo de arena de Marko, rompe una tubería grande de agua para enviar lo que él cree que es un torrente letal de agua, convirtiendo al Hombre de Arena en barro. Con ello, Peter cree haber matado a Marko y al comentarle a la tía May sobre la presunta muerte del Hombre de Arena a manos de Spider-Man, que si bien para Peter fue como vengar a su tío, ella le advierte que la venganza además de ser perjudicial para una persona, también envenena el alma y corrompe el corazón y que sin darse cuenta se convierte en alguien malo.",

Mill's explanation of the concept of utility in his work, Utilitarianism, is that people really do desire happiness, and since each individual desires their own happiness, it must follow that all of us desire the happiness of everyone, contributing to a larger social utility.

To exceed a self-sufficiency of 40% in a household equipped with photovoltaics, energy storage is needed. Multiple manufacturers produce rechargeable battery systems for storing energy, generally to hold surplus energy from home solar or wind generation.

I'm not sure if \"distributed energy\" is a term correct enough to be inferable from \"distributed generation of renewable energies\" or if \"distributed generation\" would be more accurate in case one wants to use a simpler term. \n\"el aumento (the increase)\" / \"the important share\": not the same thing. \n\"To exceed a self-sufficiency of 40% in a household equipped with photovoltaics, energy storage is needed.\" (more succinctly expressed in just one sentence) / \"Un hogar equipado con energía fotovoltaica puede asegurar hasta un 40% de sus necesidades energéticas.

  "text": "The symptoms of diphtheria usually begin two to seven days after infection. They include fever of 38 °C (100.4 °F) or above; chills; fatigue; bluish skin coloration (cyanosis); sore throat; hoarseness; cough; headache; difficulty swallowing; painful swallowing; difficulty breathing; rapid breathing; foul-smelling and bloodstained nasal discharge; and lymphadenopathy. Within two to three days, diphtheria may destroy healthy tissues in the respiratory system. The dead tissue forms a thick, gray coating that can build up in the throat or nose. This thick gray coating is called a \"pseudomembrane\". It can cover tissues in the nose, tonsils, voice box, and throat, making it very hard to breathe and swallow. Symptoms can also include cardiac arrhythmias, myocarditis, and cranial and peripheral nerve palsies.",

  "premise": "Existen dos cuadros clásicos de difteria: uno en la nariz y la garganta y otro en la piel. Los síntomas principales son el dolor de garganta, un aumento leve de la temperatura corporal y ganglios linfáticos (nódulos linfáticos) inflamados en el cuello. Además, se puede formar una membrana en la garganta. Las lesiones de la piel pueden ser dolorosas, de aspecto hinchado y enrojecido. También se reconocen con menor frecuencia cuadros iniciales de infección cutánea, vaginal, de conjuntivas oculares u oídos. Los síntomas suelen aparecer a los 3 a 9 días. Si no aparecen antes o después, se debe acudir a un hospital entre 24 a 48 horas después del contagio.",

  "text": "Distinct from a disposition to believe that things will work out, there is a philosophical idea that, perhaps in ways that may not be fully comprehended, the present moment is in an optimum state. This view that all of nature - past, present, and future - operates by laws of optimization along the lines of Hamilton's principle in the realm of physics is countered by views such as idealism, realism, and philosophical pessimism. Philosophers often link the concept of optimism with the name of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who held that we live in the best of all possible worlds (le meilleur des mondes possibles), or that God created a physical universe that applies the laws of physics. The concept was also reflected in an aspect of Francois-Marie Arouet de Voltaire's early philosophy, one that was based on Isaac Newton's view that described a divinely ordered human condition. This philosophy would also later emerge in Alexander Pope's Essay on Man.",
  "pair_type": "es-en",
  "premise": "La palabra optimismo y la importancia de creer en ti proviene del latín \"optimum\": \"lo mejor\". El término fue usado por primera vez para referirse a la doctrina sostenida por el filósofo alemán Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz en su obra Ensayos de Teodicea sobre la bondad de Dios, la libertad del hombre y el origen del mal (Ámsterdam, 1710), según la cual el mundo en el que vivimos es el mejor de los mundos posibles. Una postura parecida es sostenida con distintos matices por los filósofos William Godwin, Ralph Waldo Emerson y Friedrich Nietzsche. Por otra parte, el espíritu de algunos movimientos espirituales, como el Renacimiento y la Ilustración, fue identificado como optimista y lleno de fe en el hombre y sus posibilidades, frente a épocas opuestas y pesimistas como la Edad Media y el Barroco.",

A similar position is held with different nuances by philosophers William Godwin, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Friedrich Nietzsche.

The term was used for the first time to refer to the doctrine held by the German philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in his work Theodicy Essays on the goodness of God, the freedom of man and the origin of evil (Amsterdam, 1710), according to which The world we live in is the best of all possible worlds. A similar position is held with different nuances by the philosophers William Godwin, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Friedrich Nietzsche. On the other hand, the spirit of some spiritual movements, such as the Renaissance and the Enlightenment, was identified as optimistic and full of faith in man and his possibilities, compared to opposing and pessimistic periods such as the Middle Ages and the Baroque."

  "text": "5), Hegemon of Thasos was the inventor of a kind of parody; by slightly altering the wording in well-known poems he transformed the sublime into the ridiculous. In ancient Greek literature, a parodia was a narrative poem imitating the style and prosody of epics \"but treating light, satirical or mock-heroic subjects\". Indeed, the components of the Greek word are παρά para \"beside, counter, against\" and ᾠδή oide \"song\". Thus, the original Greek word παρῳδία parodia has sometimes been taken to mean \"counter-song\", an imitation that is set against the original. The Oxford English Dictionary, for example, defines parody as imitation \"turned as to produce a ridiculous effect\". Because par- also has the non-antagonistic meaning of beside, \"there is nothing in parodia to necessitate the inclusion of a concept of ridicule. ",

En la antigua literatura griega, una parodia era un poema narrativo que imitaba el estilo y la prosodia de la épicas \"pero que trataba temas ligeros, satíricos o burlón-heroicos\". En efecto, los componentes de la palabra griega son παρά para \"al lado, en contra, en contra\" y ᾠδή oide \"canto\". Así, la palabra griega original παρῳδία parodia se ha tomado a veces para significar \"contracanción\", una imitación que se contrapone al original. El Oxford English Dictionary, por ejemplo, define la parodia como la imitación \"vuelta como para producir un efecto ridículo\". Dado que par- también tiene el significado no antagónico de al lado, \"no hay nada en parodia que haga necesaria la inclusión de un concepto de ridiculez\".",

Altered blood bears resemblance to coffee grounds (as the iron in the blood is oxidized) and, when this matter is identified, the term coffee-ground vomiting is used. Bile can enter the vomit during subsequent heaves due to duodenal contraction if the vomiting is severe. Fecal vomiting is often a consequence of intestinal obstruction or a gastrocolic fistula and is treated as a warning sign of this potentially serious problem (signum mali ominis).",

Vómito bilioso es el nombre del vómito que contiene bilis producto de la contracción duodenal en caso de estar acompañado por arcadas muy fuertes. El vómito fecaloideo se caracteriza por contener restos oscuros, putrefactos y de mal olor a causa de una obstrucción intestinal o de una fístula gastrocólica.",

Nevertheless,  I'll label the paragraphs because there is a lot of overlapping if they are in fact talking about the same kind of professionals. \n\nFor the most part, EV describes what athletic trainers do in a neutral tone; it only uses the word \"key\", which matches the word \"esencial\" (essential) in SV.  Besides that, SV is emphatic in the importance of what they do with expressions such as: \n- typically (relating to frequency) / fundamental (fundamental) (relating to essence) \n- crucial (crucial) (used twice) with no corresponding span in EV\n\nathletic trainers (professionals, people) / la fisioterapia (physiotherapy or physical therapy) (major, academic field) \nEquivalence: therapeutic intervention / el tratamiento (the treatment)\nEquivalence: key to treatment and rehabilitation / esencial para ayudar a los atletas a recuperarse de lesions (essential for helping athletes recuperate from lesions)",

  "text": "Herat is first recorded in ancient times, but its precise date of foundation is unknown. Under the Persian Achaemenid Empire (550–330 BC), the surrounding district was known by the Old Persian name of Haraiva (𐏃𐎼𐎡𐎺), and in classical sources, the region was correspondingly known as Areia (Aria). In the Zoroastrian collection of Avesta, the district is referred as Haroiva. The name of the district and its principal town is a derivative from that of the local river, the Herey River (from Old Iranian Harayu, meaning \"with velocity\"), which goes through the district and ends south of Herat. Herey is mentioned in Sanskrit as a yellow or golden color equivalent to Persian \"Zard\" meaning Gold (yellow). The naming of a region and its principal town after the main river is a common feature in this part of the world— compare the adjoining districts/rivers/towns of Arachosia and Bactria.",

C.), los alrededores del distrito fueron conocidos como Haraiva (en persa antiguo), y según fuentes clásicas la región fue conocida como Aria (Areia). En el Avesta zoroastriano, la ciudad es mencionada como Haroiva. El nombre del distrito y su ciudad principal deriva del río principal de la región, el Hari Rud (antiguo persa harayu, ‘con velocidad’), el cual cruza el distrito y pasa justo al sur (5 km) de la moderna Herāt. El nombrar una región y su principal ciudad por su río principal es una característica muy común en esta parte del mundo.",
