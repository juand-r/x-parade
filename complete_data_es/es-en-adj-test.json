By definition, a species is a set of organisms in which the members have similar characteristics to each other and can breed with each other, while a hybrid is an organism produced by interbreeding of two different species and they are sterile. \nThe English version states that the plant is indigenous to Europe, which is equivalent to saying it spontaneously appears in Europe in the Spanish version (\"se produce espontáneamente en\" \"Europa\").  \n",

  "text": "Pepper loses flavour and aroma through evaporation, so airtight storage helps preserve its spiciness longer. Pepper can also lose flavour when exposed to light, which can transform piperine into nearly tasteless isochavicine. Once ground, pepper's aromatics can evaporate quickly; most culinary sources recommend grinding whole peppercorns immediately before use for this reason. Handheld pepper mills or grinders, which mechanically grind or crush whole peppercorns, are used for this as an alternative to pepper shakers that dispense ground pepper. Spice mills such as pepper mills were found in European kitchens as early as the 14th century, but the mortar and pestle used earlier for crushing pepper have remained a popular method for centuries, as well.",

Otra forma de que la pimienta pierda sabor es exponerla a la luz demasiado tiempo, ya que puede transformar la piperina en isochavicina (casi insípida). Una vez molida, los compuestos aromáticos de la pimienta pueden evaporarse rápidamente siendo por esto por lo que en las recetas culinarias se recomienda moler los granos de pimienta enteros inmediatamente antes de su uso. Para esto se usan los molinillos de pimienta que muelen o machacan los granos de pimienta enteros en vez de las pimenteras con pimienta ya molida. Los molinillos de pimienta han sido usados en las cocinas europeas desde el s. XIV, pero el mortero, usado antes de estos para machacar la pimienta, siguió siendo un método popular también durante siglos.",

  "text": "Alpher and Herman were able to estimate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background to be 5 K, though two years later they re-estimated it at 28 K. This high estimate was due to a misestimate of the Hubble constant by Alfred Behr, which could not be replicated and was later abandoned for the earlier estimate. Although there were several previous estimates of the temperature of space, these estimates had two flaws. First, they were measurements of the temperature of space and did not suggest that space was filled with a thermal Planck spectrum. Next, they depend on our being at a special spot at the edge of the Milky Way galaxy and they did not suggest the radiation is isotropic. The estimates would yield very different predictions if Earth happened to be located elsewhere in the universe.",

Aunque había varias estimaciones previas de la temperatura del espacio (ver cronología), estas sufrieron dos defectos. En primer lugar, fueron medidas de la temperatura efectiva del espacio y no sugieren que el espacio fue rellenado con un espectro de Planck térmico. Y en segundo lugar, son dependientes de nuestro lugar especial en el extremo de la Vía Láctea y no sugieren que la radiación es isótropa.",

  "text": "In 1769, Joseph Banks was stationed in Tahiti as part of the expedition commanded by Captain James Cook. The late-18th-century quest for cheap, high-energy food sources for slaves in British colonies prompted colonial administrators and plantation owners to call for breadfruit to be brought to the Caribbean. As president of the Royal Society, Banks provided a cash bounty and gold medal for success in this endeavor, and successfully lobbied for a British Naval expedition. After an unsuccessful voyage to the South Pacific to collect the plants as commander of , in 1791, William Bligh commanded a second expedition with and , which collected seedless breadfruit plants in Tahiti and transported these to St. Helena in the Atlantic and St. Vincent and Jamaica in the West Indies.",
  "pair_type": "es-en",
  "premise": "El rico contenido en glúcidos del fruto del pan propició que varios personajes británicos como Joseph Banks extendiera el cultivo del árbol del pan por el Caribe y así disponer de un alimento altamente nutritivo y de fácil cultivo para los esclavos americanos de las Antillas. Por esta razón, en 1787 la Marina Real de Gran Bretaña ordenó la salida del HMAV Bounty, encargado de llegar hasta Tahití y obtener especímenes del árbol del pan y transportarlas al Caribe, donde iniciar su reproducción. El mando del navío recayó en William Bligh, que por su carácter duro y severo, y sus decisiones arbitrarias, logró empeorar las relaciones a bordo. El 26 de octubre de 1788 llegaron a Tahití, y se llevaron 1.015 ejemplares del árbol del pan. Cuando estalló el motín a la vuelta hacia Gran Bretaña, los amotinados lanzaron por la borda todos los ejemplares del árbol del pan, en señal de rebelión contra Bligh, más preocupado del cuidado de las plantas que de sus propios hombres.",

    "comment": "\"The late-18th-century quest for cheap, high-energy food sources for slaves in British colonies\" is expressed as a much larger scale event than just the search for a particular food (breadfruit) brought from Tahiti to the Antilles, as put in the Spanish version (SV).\n\"prompted (...) to call for breadfruit\" (just in the stage of search) / \"propició que (...) extendiera el cultivo\" (fostered (...) the expansion of the crop) (already at the stage of farming).\nThe dates of the expeditions don't match. and some words are missing in the last part of the English version (EV), making it hard to understand and compare. Not sure if the \"unsuccessful voyage\" mentioned (EV) is the same one with the rebellion (SV).\n\n",

Como expone en su libro De Genesi ad litteram (\"Sobre la interpretación literal del Génesis\"), creía que en algunos casos las nuevas criaturas se formaban debido a la «descomposición» de formas de vida más primitivas. Para él, «plantas, aves de corral y animales no son perfectos... pero fueron creados en un estado de potencialidad». No obstante, consideraba teológicamente perfectos a los ángeles, al firmamento y al alma humana. Su idea de que los seres vivos se transformaban lentamente con el tiempo llevó a Giuseppe Tanzella-Nitti, profesor de teología de la Pontificia Universidad de la Santa Cruz, en Roma, a afirmar que Agustín había sugerido una forma de evolución.",

Close, but not the same.\nforehead (part of the face) / cara (face, implies the entire face)\n\"algunas marcas de facción más marcadas\" (literally, some marks of features more marked)  sounds weird in Spanish, since \"facción\", or better yet \"facciones\" (features), already refers to lines or shapes of the face. Plus, \"marcas\" (marks) and \"marcadas\" (marked) also seem redundant.  So, it would make more sense for SV to simply go: \"algunas facciones más marcadas\" (some more pronounced features). In any case, that span could correspond or be inferable from \"has a more curved forehead and sloping snout\", but I'm not sure if those are the features that the SV is referring to. ",

This succulence enables the species to survive in areas of low natural rainfall, making it ideal for rockeries and other low water-use gardens. The species is hardy in zones 8–11, and is intolerant of heavy frost and snow. The species is relatively resistant to most insect pests, though spider mites, mealy bugs, scale insects, and aphid species may cause a decline in plant health. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.",

  "text": "The successful 2014 Northern Iraq offensive by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, with the resultant weakening of the ability of the Iraqi state to project power, also presented a \"golden opportunity\" for the Kurds to increase their independence and possibly declare an independent Kurdish state. The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, who took more than 80 Turkish persons captive in Mosul during their offensive, is an enemy of Turkey, making Kurdistan useful for Turkey as a buffer state. On 28 June 2014 Hüseyin Çelik, a spokesman for the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), made comments to the Financial Times indicating Turkey's readiness to accept an independent Kurdistan in northern Iraq.",

Por otra parte, combatientes y civiles kurdos fueron arrestados y torturados por el ejército del califato lo que motivó la creación de fuerzas de autodefensa en parte del territorio. Al mismo tiempo el Comité Supremo Kurdo encabeza los combates contra el Estado Islámico aliado tanto con la coalición occidental liderada por los Estados Unidos como con las fuerzas rusas. ",

  "text": "Martin Van Buren ( December 5, 1782 – July 24, 1862) was an American lawyer and statesman who served as the eighth president of the United States from 1837 to 1841. A primary founder of the Democratic Party, he served as New York's attorney general, U.S. senator, then briefly as the ninth governor of New York before joining Andrew Jackson's administration as the tenth United States secretary of state, minister to the United Kingdom, and ultimately the eighth vice president when named Jackson's running mate for the 1832 election. Van Buren won the presidency in 1836, lost re-election in 1840, and failed to win the Democratic nomination in 1844. Later in his life, Van Buren emerged as an elder statesman and an important anti-slavery leader who led the Free Soil Party ticket in the 1848 presidential election.",

Uno de los fundadores del partido demócrata, Van Buren fue el noveno gobernador del estado de New York, el décimo Secretario de Estado de los Estados Unidos, y el octavo Vicepresidente de los Estados Unidos. Ganó las elecciones presidenciales de Estados Unidos de 1836 con el apoyo del presidente previo Andrew Jackson y la fuerte organización política del partido demócrata. Perdió la reelección del año 1840 a William Henry Harrison por causa de la pobre economía causada en gran parte por el pánico de 1837. Después en su vida llegó a ser una figura importante para la causa en contra de la esclavitud y apoyo al partido \"Free Soil Party\" (Partido de Tierra Libre) en 1848.",

I don't know much about U.S. politics but these terms don't seem equivalent in the degree of involvement.  ",

    "comment": "\"donde comenzó a estudiar Derecho\" (where he started studying law) / \"where he eventually studied medicine\". It seems like the SV tells the story from the beginning where Schiller began studying law and suffered severe training and the EV skips that part and tells the story where he eventually switched his studies to medicine (I'm assuming) and suffers from illnesses. That's how I'm reconciling both versions.   ",

Neo takes the red pill, and his reality begins to distort, awakening in a liquid-filled pod among countless other pods, containing other humans. He is then brought aboard Morpheus's flying ship, the Nebuchadnezzar. As Neo recuperates from a lifetime of physical inactivity in the pod, Morpheus explains the situation: In the early 21st century, a war broke out between humanity and intelligent machines. After humans blocked the machines' access to solar energy, the machines responded by enslaving humankind and harvesting their bioelectric power while keeping their minds pacified in the Matrix, a shared simulated reality modeled on the world as it was in 1999. In the years following, the remaining free humans took refuge in the underground city of Zion.",

Around 100,000 years ago, olives were used by humans in Africa, on the Atlantic coast of Morocco, for fuel management and most probably for consumption. Wild olive trees, or oleasters, were present and collected in the Eastern Mediterranean since ~19,000 BP.

Hace 100 000 años, los humanos utilizaban las aceitunas en África, en la costa atlántica de Marruecos, para la gestión del combustible y muy probablemente para el consumo. Los acebuches silvestres estuvieron presentes y recolectados en el Mediterráneo oriental desde ~19,000 AP. El genoma de las aceitunas cultivadas refleja su origen a partir de poblaciones de acebuches en el Mediterráneo oriental.

  "text": "A character called a sokuon, which is visually identical to a small tsu ッ, indicates that the following consonant is geminated (doubled). This is represented in rōmaji by doubling the consonant that follows the sokuon. In Japanese this is an important distinction in pronunciation; for example, compare サカ saka \"hill\" with サッカ sakka \"author\". Geminated consonants are common in transliterations of foreign loanwords; for example, English \"bed\" is represented as ベッド (beddo). The sokuon also sometimes appears at the end of utterances, where it denotes a glottal stop. However, it cannot be used to double the na, ni, nu, ne, no syllables' consonants; to double these, the singular n (ン) is added in front of the syllable. The sokuon may also be used to approximate a non-native sound: Bach is written (Bahha); Mach as (Mahha).",

  "premise": "Para transcribir una consonante sola o seguida por otra consonante se elige el carácter que equivalga al valor de la consonante + u. Esto es así porque en japonés la u se pronuncia débilmente. Sin embargo, como tu y du no existen en japonés, la t y la d sueltas se transcriben como to y do, respectivamente. Ejemplos: キス (kisu, del inglés kiss: beso) y ヒント (hinto, del inglés hint: pista). Si esa consonante se pronuncia de modo brusco o acentuado, en katakana se convierte en consonante doble. Ejemplo: ベッド (beddo, del inglés bed: cama). Esto produce que, para palabras que tengan una sílaba con 'u' se doblen. Los sonidos que no existen en japonés se sustituyen por los que les sean afines.",

Examples:  (kisu, from English kiss: kiss) and  (hinto, from English hint: track). If that consonant is pronounced abruptly or accentuated, katakana becomes a double consonant. Example:  (beddo, from English bed: bed). This results in, for words that have a syllable with 'u' being doubled.

Examples: キス (kisu, from English kiss: kiss) and ヒント (hinto, from English hint: hint). If that consonant is pronounced roughly or stressed, in katakana it becomes a double consonant.

This is so because in Japanese the u is pronounced weakly. However, since tu and du do not exist in Japanese, the loose t and d are transcribed as to and do, respectively. Examples: キス (kisu, from English kiss: kiss) and ヒント (hinto, from English hint: hint). If that consonant is pronounced abruptly or accentuated, in katakana it becomes a double consonant. Example: ベッド (beddo, from English bed: bed). This produces that, for words that have a syllable with 'u', they are doubled. Sounds that do not exist in Japanese are replaced with sounds that are related to them."

At approximately the sixteenth day of human development, the embryo begins to fold ventrally (with the embryo's ventral surface becoming concave) in two directions: the sides of the embryo fold in on each other and the head and tail fold toward one another. The result is that a piece of the yolk sac, an endoderm-lined structure in contact with the ventral aspect of the embryo, begins to be pinched off to become the primitive gut. The yolk sac remains connected to the gut tube via the vitelline duct. Usually, this structure regresses during development; in cases where it does not, it is known as Meckel's diverticulum.",

El resultado es una pieza del saco vitelino, una estructura revestida de endodermo en contacto con la cara ventral del embrión, comienza a ser pellizcado para convertirse en el intestino primitivo.

  "text": "Montesquieu's most influential work divided French society into three classes (or trias politica, a term he coined): the monarchy, the aristocracy, and the commons. Montesquieu saw two types of governmental power existing: the sovereign and the administrative. The administrative powers were the executive, the legislative, and the judicial. These should be separate from and dependent upon each other so that the influence of any one power would not be able to exceed that of the other two, either singly or in combination. This was a radical idea because it does not follow the three Estates structure of the French Monarchy: the clergy, the aristocracy, and the people at large represented by the Estates-General, thereby erasing the last vestige of a feudalistic structure.",

La teoría sobre la división de poderes encontró en Montesquieu a su máximo exponente, desarrollando este una célebre tesis que serviría como modelo y punto de partida a los gobernantes posteriores de los siglos y , aunque su teoría no sea la única realizada para tratar el tema. La estructura que presenta Montesquieu sobre la división de poderes está influenciada por la práctica constitucionalista británica donde existen sistemas de frenos, contrapesos y controles que esta utiliza según un modelo racionalista. Montesquieu atribuye al Parlamento el poder legislativo con la sanción real de la ley, el ejecutivo al gobierno, y el judicial a los tribunales de justicia.",

La idea se remonta a cuando el director, Andrew Stanton, era un niño; le gustaba ir al dentista a ver la pecera y asumió que los peces eran del océano y querían volver a casa. En 1992, poco después de que su hijo naciera, él y su familia viajaron al Six Flags Discovery Kingdom (que se llamaba Marine World en aquella época), donde sintió que el mundo submarino podría realizarse hermosamente mediante animación por ordenador. Más tarde, en 1997, mientras daba con su hijo un paseo por el parque, se dio cuenta de que lo sobreprotegía constantemente y que había perdido una oportunidad de tener «experiencias padre-hijo» aquel día. En una entrevista con la revista National Geographic, declaró que la idea para los personajes de Marlin y Nemo vino de una fotografía de dos peces payaso saliendo de una anémona:",

Fue nombrado por Clinton Hart Merriam en 1898 en honor del presidente, Theodore Roosevelt, cazador y naturalista aficionado. Muy parecido al ciervo de las Montañas Rocosas, el uapití de Roosevelt se diferencia de éste por su mayor tamaño (los machos suelen rondar los 450 kg) y pelaje más oscuro. Las astas poseen numerosas puntas y sus extremos pueden aparecer ligeramente palmeados.",

  "text": "Burton approached Sam Hamm, a comic book fan, to write the screenplay. Hamm decided not to use an origin story, feeling that flashbacks would be more suitable and that \"unlocking the mystery\" would become part of the storyline. He reasoned, \"You totally destroy your credibility if you show the literal process by which Bruce Wayne becomes Batman.\" Hamm replaced Silver St. Cloud with Vicki Vale and Rupert Thorne with his own creation, Carl Grissom. He completed his script in October 1986, which demoted Dick Grayson to a cameo rather than a supporting character. One scene in Hamm's script had a young James Gordon on duty the night of the murder of Bruce Wayne's parents. When Hamm's script was rewritten, the scene was deleted, reducing it to a photo in the Gotham Globe newspaper seen in the film.",

En una de las escenas se mostraba a James Gordon durante sus inicios en la policía, brindándole ayuda a Bruce Wayne después de la muerte de sus padres; finalmente se decidió omitir esta escena (si bien alcanzó a ser grabada), que más tarde fue retomada en Batman Begins.",

    "comment": "The English version states that Hamm was hired to write the screenplay, whereas the Spanish version states that Hamm was hired to edit it (meaning it was already written by someone else).\nIt seems like the end of a sentence is missing in the Spanish version: \"(...) reemplazó a Thorne por Carl Grissom y a St.\" I'm guessing what follows is \"Cloud con Vicki Vale\".  \nThe Spanish version uses the expression \"durante sus inicios en la policía\" (at the beginning of his career in the police), which is equivalent to the word \"young\" in \"young James Gordon\" in the English version.   \nIt's possible \"on duty the night of the murder of Bruce Wayne's parents\" in the English version is inferable from the Spanish version's \"brindándole ayuda a Bruce Wayne después de la muerte de sus padres\" (helping Bruce Wayne after the death of his parents) because of how popular the Batman story is. \n\n",

An increase in games played benefited Ichiro, as he accumulated only 251 hits through the first 154 games of the season. Ichiro recorded 50 hits in four different months of the year (September and October are combined by MLB for this computational purpose), becoming the first player ever to have four in a season. With 51 hits in August 2001, Ichiro joined Pete Rose as the only players with five 50-hit months in a career.",

Though he will eat nearly anything (with the exception of raisins and spinach), Garfield is particularly fond of lasagna; he also enjoys eating Jon's houseplants and other pets (mainly birds and fish).",

Le encanta comer, dormir (ambas acciones en cantidades asombrosas), ver la televisión y burlarse de Jon y Odie. Su comida favorita es la lasaña, y detesta las pasas y las espinacas. Se le ha visto cazar pájaros, pero no ratones, pues considera asqueroso comerlos. También odia a las arañas y, sobre todo, los lunes (no aplicable cuando es su cumpleaños).",

    "comment": "The Spanish version says \"Le encanta comer\" (he loves eating), which speaks about pleasure in that action, while the English version uses the expression \"obsessive eating\" and I don't think there's much pleasure in doing something obsessively.  \nThe Spanish version states \"odia a las arañas\" (he hates spiders), which seems like a stronger word than \"dislike of spiders\" in the English version. However, the degree of dislike/hatred is maintained across versions because the Spanish version continues with \"odia a las arañas y, sobre todo, los lunes\" (he hates spiders and, above all, Mondays) and the English version continues with \"his dislike of spiders, his hatred of Mondays\". \nThe Spanish version uses the word \"burlarse\" (making fun of), while the English version uses the word \"abuse\", which is not in good fun. \nAlthough the English version states that his eating is obsessive, that doesn't mean he will eat anything, so I'm not labeling it as Inferable.\nThe Spanish version uses the word \"detesta las pasas y las espinacas\" (hates raisins and spinach), while the English version says \"he will eat nearly anything (with the exception of raisins and spinach)\", which doesn't really speak about his feelings on them or, even if it's inferable that he doesn't like them, at least it doesn't sound as harsh.  \nThe Spanish version uses the expression \"Su comida favorita es la lasaña\" (his favorite food is lasagna), while the English version uses the expression \"is particularly fond of lasagna\", which doesn't necessarily place lasagna as number one.  \nThe Spanish version states \"Se le ha visto cazar pájaros, pero no ratones, pues considera asqueroso comerlos\" (he has been seen hunting birds, but not mice, since he considers them gross to eat), so it's inferable that he hunts birds in order to eat them and that would usually mean it's because he enjoys it, like the English version states (although calling his eating obsessive doesn't help the inference), so I'm labeling it as Inferable.

  "text": "With the rise of large, industrialised cities in Germany, the predator population began to decline, rendering sheepdogs unnecessary. At the same time, the awareness of sheepdogs as a versatile, intelligent class of canine began to rise. Max von Stephanitz, an ex-cavalry captain and former student of the Berlin Veterinary College, was an ex-member of the Phylax Society who firmly believed dogs should be bred for working. He admired the intelligence, strength and ability of Germany's native sheepdogs, but could not find any one single breed that satisfied him as the perfect working dog.",
  "pair_type": "es-en",
  "premise": "Von Stephanitz buscó de forma primordial el aspecto práctico y de trabajo de la raza. Desde el principio, la forma en el pastor alemán no debería desviarle de su funcionalidad zootécnica. Von Stephanitz previó una primera amenaza a la validez de la raza como animal de trabajo cuando la sociedad humana se transformó de una base principalmente agrícola y ganadera a una economía industrializada. En una primera fase, persuadió al Gobierno alemán para que aceptara a la raza en trabajos de policía. Este fue el principio de la asociación de la raza con las fuerzas de la ley y con la utilización militar. Pronto las cualidades de inteligencia, fiabilidad y resistencia del animal, los aspectos principales de su carácter y su existencia en la historia, le garantizaron su utilización en muchos papeles importantes, siendo uno de esos papeles más nobles como perro guía para los ciegos.",
