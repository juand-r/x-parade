  "premise": "Haeckel was a flamboyant figure, who sometimes took great, non-scientific leaps from available evidence. For example, at the time when Darwin published On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection (1859), Haeckel postulated that evidence of human evolution would be found in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). At that time, no remains of human ancestors had yet been identified. He described these theoretical remains in great detail and even named the as-yet unfound species, Pithecanthropus alalus, and instructed his students such as Richard and Oskar Hertwig to go and find it.",

This is reflected in and perhaps inferable from the English, but I don't think it's a very strong link. \nNevertheless, I have annotated some \"inferable\" information: the first reads \"about Darwin's theory of evolution\" and the second reads \"the origins of humanity.\"",

For example, his 1866 \"Outline of Morphology\" was the world's first textbook on Darwin's theory of evolution; in his 1874 book \"Anthropology\", he used the method of comparative anatomy to explore the evolution of humans from the animal world and the evolution of humans. The source of Phylogenetics; his \"Phylogeny\" is a masterpiece published from 1894 to 1896. It is as long as three volumes and describes his personal understanding of the evolution and kinship of the entire animal world."

However, the Chinese mentions earlier that they eat \"assorted bugs/insects,\" which is inferable from the English: We know from the English that Neuroptera are not the only kind of insect they consume. \n\nThere is a curious discrepancy found at the beginning of the Chinese sentence, which reads: \"Some people claim that the indigenous people of the New Guinea highlands....\" The English presents the \"claim\" as originating from the Highland people themselves. But because the Highlanders are also \"some people,\" technically the claim in the Chinese (\"some people claim\") is inferable; it is just a bit confusing because of course the Highlanders are evidently making a claim about themselves, which is not clear in the Chinese.

Typically, Earth scientists use tools from geology, chronology, physics, chemistry, geography, biology, and mathematics to build a quantitative understanding of how Earth works and evolves. For example, meteorologists study the weather and watch for dangerous storms. Hydrologists examine water and warn of floods. Seismologists study earthquakes and try to understand where they will strike. Geologists study rocks and help to locate useful minerals. Earth scientists often work in the field—perhaps climbing mountains, exploring the seabed, crawling through caves, or wading in swamps. They measure and collect samples (such as rocks or river water), then record their findings on charts and maps.",

    "comment": "The Chinese passage describes earth sciences as a discipline of science in which \"above, the heavens (astronomy) is understood, and below, [that knowledge is used] to understand geography.\" In other words, this expression appears to describe earth science's status as a discipline whose scope encompasses both the terrestrial and astronomical or cosmic domains. This is backed up by the English, albeit not very forcefully, by references to \"the atmosphere\" on the one hand (the Chinese also mentions \"stars,\" the sun and other heavenly bodies--星星、月亮 (the moon)、太阳 (the sun), the universe (宇宙) etc.); and \"rocks\" and \"minerals\" on the other (in the English; the Chinese also mentions rocks and minerals). On the whole, the Chinese passage is much more outspoken about the astronomical/cosmic focus of earth sciences than is the English. \n\nThe Chinese is not only somewhat hyperbolic in its description of the earth sciences; it is also more poetical (especially in the first sentence). The \"inferable\" references are really just that--inferable. For instance, \"oceans\" (海洋) are listed as a subject of study in earth sciences, but in the English, we just know that \"the seabed\" and \"water\" are germane to earth scientists' work. \n\nThe Chinese expounds on the disciplines which the English passage asserts offer \"tools\" to earth scientists (geology, biology, mathematics, etc.), explaining how \"tools\" from each of the listed disciplines may be applied to earth sciences research.\n",

It encompasses the land that people step on, the air that we breathe every minute, the oceans that are closely related to our lives, the stars, the moon, the sun, and even the entire universe that we live with day and night. are all subjects of research. Scientists use various theories to study the Earth. For example, mathematics helps calculate the trajectory of comets, the movement of air masses, and the magnitude of earthquakes; physics is used to study the Earth's gravity field, the gravitational effects between stars, and the movement of fronts or ocean currents; through Chemical knowledge can analyze the chemical composition of rocks; while biological principles can help understand the hidden meanings of fossils and further establish an evolutionary structure."

So, I am going to label it as \"inferable,\" since the English at least corroborates that a temporal unit (the \"number of hours of electricity production...\") may be used to measure \"storage capacity.\"\n\nEN: \"it may be given in number of hours\"; CN: \"the unit is commonly hours\"",

So, I have marked \"hunting and killing\" (猎杀) as \"inferable,\" although the English version does not refer explicitly to hunting and killing. \n每年 means \"every year\" or \"annually.\" In the context of the growing number of bobcats, this might be inferred from the English (in which the trend is described in more moderate terms, \"subsequent years,\" \"suggesting,\" etc.); but it is definitely a different idea than that in the English. \nWhereas only the initials IUCN are given in the English, the Chinese appears to give the whole name of the organization (世界自然保护联盟). I am considering this information \"inferable\" on this basis. I also labelled as \"inferable\" the discrepancy between the English and Chinese regarding the status given to the bobcat by this organization: The Chinese says \"temporarily not in jeopardy,\" and the English says \"least concern on the...Red List.\"\nThere may be a semantic ambiguity in the final sentence. The English says \"information from southern Mexico is poor,\" and the Chinese reflects a reading of \"poor\" information whereby \"poor\" means \"unclear.\" But because the sentence begins by describing the level of \"concern\" given to the animal, the use of \"poor\" arguably suggests that data from southern Mexico shows troubling signs, perhaps indicating a drop in population. I have marked this ambiguity as \"inferable,\" but it may be that I am reading it too closely. ",

Westminster is an discrete municipality entirely enclosed within London, and in practice Westminster is treated as a part of London. In any case, \"Westminster\" is familiar to most people, and the reference to \"London\" is arguably inferable. I would not usually claim that a reference to a district in a city makes the city itself inferable, but because Westminster is so well-known (Westminster Abbey, etc.), I will make an exception. \n\nTwo ways of rendering \"Westminster\" in Chinese are given in brackets. \n\nI have marked the reference to \"district\" (區) as inferable. See the above discussion about Westminster and London. \n\nAdditional information about the speculation around Elizabeth's birthplace, age and family is given in the Chinese.\n\n",

For example, she looked different from her parents or siblings, and she was six years older than her previous child. Urban legends once reported that she was a twin born to a certain Irish woman, and her actual age was two years older than the official record, etc."

While eventually doubting parts of his faith, Darwin continued to help in church affairs, even while avoiding church attendance. Darwin stated that it would be \"absurd to doubt that a man might be an ardent theist and an evolutionist\". Although reticent about his religious views, in 1879 he wrote that \"I have never been an atheist in the sense of denying the existence of a God. – I think that generally ... an agnostic would be the most correct description of my state of mind.\"",

  "premise": "Around 1350BC, the stability of the New Kingdom was threatened when Amenhotep IV ascended the throne and instituted a series of radical and chaotic reforms. Changing his name to Akhenaten, he touted the previously obscure sun deity Aten as the supreme deity, suppressed the worship of most other deities, and moved the capital to the new city of Akhetaten (modern-day Amarna). He was devoted to his new religion and artistic style. After his death, the cult of the Aten was quickly abandoned and the traditional religious order restored. The subsequent pharaohs, Tutankhamun, Ay, and Horemheb, worked to erase all mention of Akhenaten's heresy, now known as the Amarna Period.",

    "comment": "The Chinese passage indicates that Amenhotep IV's ascension and institution of \"radical and chaotic reforms\" \"imperiled\" (威胁到) the \"stability of the New Kingdom.\" The use of the passive voice in the English makes this causal relationship a bit murky. \n\nThe Chinese gives two glosses for Amenhotep IV's new name \"Akhenaten.\"\n\nThe Chinese also mentions that Akhenaten \"attacked the power of the 'clerical/priestly cabal'\" (僧侣集团)\n\nA gloss is also given for the name of the city Akhetaten. \n\nThe \"first name\" of the pharaoh referred to in the English as \"Ay\" is given. (I could not avoid highlighting the part that says \"Ay\" (阿伊), but it should not be highlighted).\n\nEN: \"worked to erase all mention\"; CN: \"quickly expunged\"--\"quickly\" (迅速) is not inferable. Rather than indicate that these pharaohs sought to expunge \"all mention of Akhenaten's heresy,\" the Chinese suggests that they aimed to eliminate \"all traces\" or \"records\" (所有记载) of Akhenaten in general. \n\nThe \"Amarna Period\" is described in the Chinese as \"brief\" (短暂).",

He changed his name to Akhenaten (literally \"Servant of Aten\" or \"Glorious Soul of Aten\"), exalted the previously inconspicuous sun god Aten as the highest god, banned the worship of other gods, and attacked monks The power of the group also moved the capital to the new city of Ekhtaton (meaning Aten's sight, today's Amarna). Later pharaohs Tutankhamen, Itnut Ay, and Horamheb quickly erased all records of Amenhotep IV. This short period was called the Amarna era."

The oblong hermaphrodite flowers develop The fruit is the best. Due to the difference in flower sex, plants can be divided into unisexual plants and hermaphrodite plants. Female plants only bloom female flowers, and the flower sex is stable. If pollen from hermaphrodite plants is pollinated, the fruiting will be strong, and there will also be natural parthenocarpy. Hermaphroditic plants bloom various types of flowers, which are often affected by external conditions. The flowers are unstable and produce different fruits, which is called heteromorphic fruiting."

In addition to its geographical advantages, Tijuana has become a city with rapid development of tourism and is home to many multinational groups. Warner also became one of the dominant manufacturing centers in North America, particularly for medical device manufacturing. The motto of the city of Tijuana is \"Aquíempézala Patria\" which means \"The Country Begins Here\"."

Leuschner in 1907 suggested that many comets believed to have parabolic orbits, and thus making single visits to the solar system, actually had elliptical orbits and would return after very long periods. In 1932 Estonian astronomer Ernst Öpik postulated that long-period comets originated in an orbiting cloud at the outermost edge of the Solar System. Oort independently revived the idea in 1950 as a means to resolve a paradox:",

  "translation3": "In 1932, Estonian astronomer Ernst Opik hypothesized that long-period comets originate from a cloud in the outermost reaches of the solar system. During the evolution of the solar system, the orbits of comets are not dynamically stable, and they will eventually crash into the sun or planets, or be thrown out of the solar system by the perturbations of planets. In addition, due to the highly volatile components, every time a comet approaches the sun, the radiation from the sun will gradually volatilize the comet's material until the comet disintegrates or forms a protective shell."

They are either placed in the insect superfamily Aphidoidea or into the superfamily Phylloxeroidea which contains the family Adelgidae and the family Phylloxeridae. Like aphids, phylloxera feed on the roots, leaves, and shoots of grape plants, but unlike aphids, do not produce honeydew or cornicle secretions. Phylloxera (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae) are insects which caused the Great French Wine Blight that devastated European viticulture in the 19th century. Similarly, adelgids or woolly conifer aphids, also feed on plant phloem and are sometimes described as aphids, but are more properly classified as aphid-like insects, because they have no cauda or cornicles.",

Becoming a clergyman upon his release, he died a month before his son's birth. His widow married a master bricklayer two years later. Jonson attended school in St Martin's Lane in London. Later, a family friend paid for his studies at Westminster School, where the antiquarian, historian, topographer and officer of arms William Camden (1551–1623) was one of his masters. The pupil and master became friends, and the intellectual influence of Camden's broad-ranging scholarship upon Jonson's art and literary style remained notable, until Camden's death in 1623.",

In June 1842 they passed two bills that would raise tariffs and unconditionally extend the distribution program. Believing it improper to continue distribution at a time when federal revenue shortage necessitated increasing the tariff, Tyler vetoed both bills, burning any remaining bridges between himself and the Whigs. Congress tried again, combining the two into one bill; Tyler vetoed it again, to the dismay of many in Congress, who nevertheless failed to override the veto. As some action was necessary, Whigs in Congress, led by the House Ways and Means chairman Millard Fillmore, passed in each house (by one vote) a bill restoring tariffs to 1832 levels and ending the distribution program. Tyler signed the Tariff of 1842 on August 30, pocket vetoing a separate bill to restore distribution.",

In June 1842, it passed a bill to increase tariffs and unconditionally extend the time limit of the allocation plan. Taylor believed that it was unwise to continue allocating funds to the states when tariffs must be raised to cope with federal revenue shortfalls. He vetoed two bills, leaving no room for accommodation with the Whigs. Congress merged the two bills and passed them again, but the president still vetoed them. Although members of Congress were dissatisfied, they could not reach the absolute majority required to overturn the veto. The revenue problem had to be alleviated through measures. Whig congressmen, led by Millard Fillmore, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, passed bills in both houses with a one-vote advantage to restore the tariff to the 1832 level and suspend the distribution plan."

And since we cannot determine with certainty that a complaint filed with the US International Trade Commission is necessarily a lawsuit, we must declare that \"file suit,\" as it appears in the Chinese, represents new information. Moreover, although we know that HTC returned in kind, filing a complaint against Apple for patent infringement, we cannot be certain that this action manifested as a countersuit (回诉). So, this term must be \"new information,\" too. \n\nThe English does not provide enough evidence to support the claim in the Chinese that these two complaints constituted the opening salvo of a protracted \"lawsuit war\" between HTC and Apple. The Chinese continues to describe the \"32-month\" battle that unfolded, as well as its resolution--none of which is described in the English.",

In December 2011, the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled that some HTC devices infringed Apple's patents and would ban certain models of mobile phones from being sold in the United States. In November 2012, HTC and Apple issued a joint statement to end the 32-month patent litigation battle. The two parties reached a settlement and would cancel all global patent litigation disputes and sign a ten-year patent licensing contract, covering both parties' existing and patents held in the future."

I was far from ever studying this sort of math. ",

  "premise": "Peas are annual plants, with a life cycle of one year. They are a cool-season crop grown in many parts of the world; planting can take place from winter to early summer depending on location. The average pea weighs between 0.1 and 0.36 gram. The immature peas (and in snow peas the tender pod as well) are used as a vegetable, fresh, frozen or canned; varieties of the species typically called field peas are grown to produce dry peas like the split pea shelled from a matured pod. These are the basis of pease porridge and pea soup, staples of medieval cuisine; in Europe, consuming fresh immature green peas was an innovation of early modern cuisine.",

Before sowing, the seeds need to be soaked in cold water. Applying nitrogen fertilizer is beneficial to the growth of stems and leaves and promotes luxuriant pea seedlings. Watering is especially needed when pods are formed. The yield of bean-eating varieties can reach 3.2 tons of dry beans per hectare, the pod-eating varieties can reach 16 tons of fresh pods per hectare, and the special seedling-eating varieties can be harvested multiple times, with the cumulative yield reaching 12.8 tons of young shoots per hectare."

This Council decreed that the cardinal electors must meet within ten days of the pope's death, and that they must remain in seclusion until a pope has been elected; this was prompted by the three-year sede vacante following the death of Clement IV in 1268. By the mid-16th century, the electoral process had evolved into its present form, allowing for variation in the time between the death of the pope and the meeting of the cardinal electors. Traditionally, the vote was conducted by acclamation, by selection (by committee), or by plenary vote. Acclamation was the simplest procedure, consisting entirely of a voice vote.",

It was first announced by Bill Gates on August 1, 1988, at COMDEX in Las Vegas. Initially a marketing term for an office suite (bundled set of productivity applications), the first version of Office contained Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint. Office applications have grown substantially closer with shared features such as a common spell checker, Object Linking and Embedding data integration and Visual Basic for Applications scripting language.

    "comment": "While the English describes the \"office suite\" as a \"bundled set of productivity applications,\" the Chinese makes an addition: \"a compilation of software (applications) that previously were once sold/marketed individually.\" This is arguably inferable, but it's a bit of a stretch. We might assume that to bundle a set of productivity applications, they would have to first already exist. We might take a further step, suggesting that these applications might already have been on the market as a stand-alone product or service. While there is a logic to this sequence of reasoning, there simply is not enough information given in the English to call the claim in the Chinese--specifically, that the contents of the suite were \"once sold/marketed individually\" (以前曾单独发售)--inferable. \n\n\"Application\" may be basically synonymous (in this context) with \"software\" (软件), but as far as I'm concerned, not all software are \"applications.\" The fact that the Chinese entry uses \"software,\" and not one of the several terms that more precisely mean \"application\" (for instance, 应用程序, literally, 'application program,' which appears two sentences later) is suggestive of a very slight discrepancy here with the English. So, 软件 (software) is inferable. \n\nThe Chinese lends some context to the assertion in the English that \"Office applications have grown substantially closer,\" by adding: \"With changes over time...\" (随着时间的改变). The Chinese also adds \"gradually\" (逐渐). \n\nThe idea of \"closeness\" (整合) and \"shared\" (共享) are presented as two separate, but related phenomena in the Chinese, while in the English, the \"shared\" idea is presented as part of the overall \"closeness\" of the suite's software, which has increased \"substantially\" over time. \n\nEN: \"a common spell checker\"; CN: \"spelling and grammar (语法) checking.\" \n\n\"Object Linking and Embedding\" is represented in the Chinese as the initials \"OLE.\" The same goes for \"Visual Basic for Applications\" (VBA). \n\nContext, which is missing from the English, about Office's status as \"a development platform\" is given; and the idea of a \"development platform\" is expanded upon in the Chinese in a slightly different way than it is in the English.

Manson's September 1961 annual review noted he had a \"tremendous drive to call attention to himself\", an observation echoed in September 1964. During the process she alleged that she and Manson had a son, Charles Luther. According to a popular urban legend, Manson auditioned unsuccessfully for the Monkees in late 1965; this is refuted by the fact that Manson was still incarcerated at McNeil Island at that time.",

The ability of these patches to expand and change color is attributed to this communicative ability--these functions aid in \"transmitting information\" (傳達訊息) to other birds.

During a live news conference to promote condom use among truck drivers, he embraced Bollywood superstar Shilpa Shetty, dipped her, and kissed her several times on the cheek. As a result of that gesture, a local court ordered the arrest of Gere and Shetty, finding them in violation of public obscenity laws. Gere has said the controversy was \"manufactured by a small hard-line political party\". About a month later, a two-judge bench headed by the Chief Justice of India, K. G. Balakrishnan, described the case as \"frivolous\" and believed that such complaints against celebrities were filed for \"cheap publicity\" and have brought a bad name to the country. They ruled that Gere would remain free to enter the country.",

    "comment": "The Chinese excerpt has the date of Gere's visit to India as August 15, not April 15, as the English suggests. \n\nWe infer that Gere \"went to India\" (到印度) because the location of the conference, Jaipur, is a city in India. \n\nThe Chinese condenses the content of the English passage somewhat, writing: \"When, on August 15, 2007, Gere went to India to participate in AIDS Awareness, Gere hugged and kissed Bollywood female star Shilpa Shetty multiple times during a live media broadcast.\" Actually, we do not know that Gere \"embraced\" (擁抱) Shetty \"multiple times\" (數次); although we know that he kissed her multiple times. Thus, perhaps a little bit facetiously, \"multiple times hugged\" (數次擁抱) must be regarded as \"new information\" that a reader could not infer from the English. \n\nWe know that Shetty is a Bollywood star, and we know that she is a \"she\" (\"her\"); thus, we can infer that Shetty is a \"Bollywood female star\" (寶萊塢女星). \n\nAs an aside, this passage appears to have some simplified characters mixed in with traditional characters. \"Bollywood,\" for example, is written in simplified (宝莱坞).\n\nThe information about the respective arrest of and charges against Gere and Shetty are presented in reverse order in the Chinese. \n\nEN: \"About a month later\"; CN: \"several months later\" (數月後)\n\nThe Chinese suggests that the \"frivolous\" comment came from \"two Chief Justices,\" while the English suggests that it came from \"a two-judge bench headed by the Chief Justice.\" Thus, although the discrepancy is subtle, \"two Chief Justices\" (兩位首席法官) must be regarded as \"new information\" that is not inferable. \n\nThe Chinese condenses the judges' opinion, reading: \"two Chief Justices believed that the case was overly frivolous,\" and \"might give India a bad name.\"\n\nThe English merely notes that the judges \"ruled that Gere would remain free to enter the country,\" while the Chinese indicates that the judges \"thusly (因而) revoked the sentence against Richard Gere that [he was] prohibited from entering [India]'s borders.\" We could not, having read the English, know that Gere's future entry to the country had already been prohibited; all we would know for sure was that Gere would not, according to the two-judge bench's decision, face a restriction from entering India in the future. Thus, this section of the Chinese is not inferable.  \n",

Ludwig von Mises of the Austrian school of economics argued that socialism would inevitably fail economically because the economic calculation problem destined the government to never correctly calculate an extremely complex economic system. As long as there is no price mechanism, the socialist government will not be able to obtain information about market demand due to information asymmetry, and what will follow will inevitably be the failure of the plan and the complete collapse of the economy."

But Gandhi's tenure is stated as sixteen years, while in the English it is noted as having lasted just four years. ",

(Rossum's Universal Robots), which was published in 1920. The word robot comes from the Slavic word robota, which means labour and originally forced labour. The play begins in a factory that makes artificial people called robots, creatures who can be mistaken for humans – very similar to the modern ideas of androids. Karel Čapek himself did not coin the word. He wrote a short letter in reference to an etymology in the Oxford English Dictionary in which he named his brother Josef Čapek as its actual originator.",

In a genetic survey of nearly 30,000 people, two genetic variants linked to the perception of coriander have been found, the most common of which is a gene involved in sensing smells. The gene OR6A2 lies within a cluster of olfactory-receptor genes, and encodes a receptor that is highly sensitive to aldehyde chemicals. Flavour chemists have found that the coriander aroma is created by a half-dozen substances, most of which are aldehydes. Those who dislike the taste are sensitive to the offending unsaturated aldehydes and, at the same time, may be unable to detect the aromatic chemicals that others find pleasant. Association between its taste and several other genes, including a bitter-taste receptor, have also been found.",

But because these statements are only slightly different, I am labelling this information as \"inferable.\" It is also worth noting that the idea expressed in the English (which includes the implied verb phrase 'there is/was') might be difficult to render into Chinese without causing some slight difference in interpretation.",

But we do not know that the play \"caused a sensation,\" nor that it was his masterpiece, especially because the English mentions another play, Medée, which is not mentioned in the Chinese. \n\nThe Chinese describes Le Cid as a \"great work\" (佳作), which may be inferred from the English (in which Le Cid is mentioned as a play which helped Corneille cement his \"mark on the world of tragedy\").\n\nThe English does not mention Jean Racine or Bérénice at all.

Other symptoms may include joint swelling, decreased range of motion, and, when the back is affected, weakness or numbness of the arms and legs. The most commonly involved joints are the two near the ends of the fingers and the joint at the base of the thumbs, the knee and hip joints, and the joints of the neck and lower back. The symptoms can interfere with work and normal daily activities. Unlike some other types of arthritis, only the joints, not internal organs, are affected.",

The male has a pair of clasping organs attached to a ring structure, and during copulation, a tubular structure is extruded and inserted into the female's vagina. A spermatophore is deposited in the female, following which the sperm make their way to a seminal receptacle where they are stored for later use. In both sexes, the genitalia are adorned with various spines, teeth, scales and bristles, which act to prevent the butterfly from mating with an insect of another species. After it emerges from its pupal stage, a butterfly cannot fly until the wings are unfolded. A newly emerged butterfly needs to spend some time inflating its wings with hemolymph and letting them dry, during which time it is extremely vulnerable to predators.",

The Spanish press (and Real Madrid TV) reported that Bale had cost £77 million (€91 million), while the British press reported a world record transfer fee of £85.3 million (€100 million), which would be above Cristiano Ronaldo's transfer record fee of £80 million (€94 million). However, in January 2016, documents pertaining to the transfer were leaked by Football Leaks which confirmed a world record transfer fee of €100.8 million (£85.1 million). Bale's record was surpassed in August 2016 by Paul Pogba's record fee of €105 million (£89.2 million). Bale was assigned the number 11 shirt at Madrid.",

This is inferable from the varying fees proposed by different media outlets in the English. \n\nThere is a strange discrepancy here: The Chinese adds that the club president announced that the value of the deal was 91 million Euros, which is consistent with the fee proposed by Real Madrid TV and \"the Spanish press,\" but evidently different from that fee, as well, because the value of the transfer in pounds is given, according to the account from Peres (the club president), as 78 million pounds.

Development of 86-DOS took only six weeks, as it was basically a clone of Digital Research's CP/M (for 8080/Z80 processors), ported to run on 8086 processors and with two notable differences compared to CP/M: an improved disk sector buffering logic, and the introduction of FAT12 instead of the CP/M filesystem. This first version was shipped in August 1980. Microsoft, which needed an operating system for the IBM Personal Computer, hired Tim Paterson in May 1981 and bought 86-DOS 1.10 for in July of the same year. Microsoft kept the version number, but renamed it MS-DOS. They also licensed MS-DOS 1.10/1.14 to IBM, which, in August 1981, offered it as PC DOS 1.0 as one of three operating systems for the IBM 5150 or the IBM PC.",

We know from the English that she was born in the Bronx, and that she lived there until she was five, but it is not clear whether Yorktown Heights is in the Bronx from the English (in fact, it is not in the Bronx, or even in New York City, but in neighboring Westchester County). \n\nEN: \"her mother was born in Puerto Rico\"; CN: \"her mother was from Puerto Rico/her mother came from Puerto Rico.\" The Chinese also states that her father was \"a New Yorker,\" which is inferable from the English (which informs us he was born in the Bronx). \n\nThe Chinese describes AOC's college education and her post-graduation career.

The first surgery on the heart itself was performed by Axel Cappelen on 4 September 1895 at Rikshospitalet in Kristiania, now Oslo. Cappelen ligated a bleeding coronary artery in a 24-year-old man who had been stabbed in the left axilla and was in deep shock upon arrival. The patient awoke and seemed fine for 24 hours but became ill with a fever and died three days after the surgery from mediastinitis.",

The surgery is described as an \"open surgery\" on the pericardium performed for a patient whose pericardium had \"filled with water\" (积水). The other surgeons who performed these early operations are not named. \n\nThe Chinese mentions that in 1896, the risk associated with performing surgery on the heart was \"extremely high,\" which can be inferred from the fact, conveyed in the English, that the first time this surgery had ever even been attempted was only a year prior, and of course, because the heart is the vital organ of the body which sustains life (meaning that a botched surgery could kill the patient).",

On September 7, 1896, Dr. Ludwig Rehn of Frankfurt, Germany, repaired a patient's punctured right ventricle. He fully recovered after the operation, becoming the first successful cardiac surgery. At that time, the risks of heart surgery were extremely high. The famous Austrian doctor Theodor Billroth (1829-1894) once said: “To operate on the heart is a blasphemy to the art of surgery."

The Games were the first to be televised, with radio broadcasts reaching 41 countries. Filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl was commissioned by the German Olympic Committee to film the Games for $7 million. Her film, titled Olympia, pioneered many of the techniques now common in the filming of sports.",

    "comment": "First of all, we know from the English paragraph that we are talking about the Berlin Olympics, which took place in 1936. And, we can infer from the Chinese itself that the site of the stadium was Berlin--we know, for instance, that Hitler ordained \"subsidy for the Berlin Olympics\" (資助柏林奧運) and instructed that \"in Berlin there be built a...stadium\" (在柏林修建...體育場). Therefore, we can infer, as the Chinese suggests, that the 100,000-seat stadium was an \"Olympic stadium\" (奧林匹克體育場) in Berlin (柏林).\n\nThe stadium is referred to as a \"體育場,\" which is commonly the Chinese term for \"stadium,\" but technically means \"athletics field,\" (體育 meaning \"athletics,\" and 場 meaning \"field/space\"). The sense of \"track and field\" (which is used by the English) is well accounted for in this Chinese term. \n\nIn the Chinese, the explanation given for Hitler's order to \"subsidize the Berlin olympics\" and \"build a...stadium\" is that Hitler sought to marshal \"all [our] ability to aid [in] the Olympics.\" Also implied is that Hitler did so to show off the might of the German state, the ascendant Nazi regime, and to impress the visiting International Olympic Committee delegation. So, the term \"为此\" in the Chinese, which means, \"to that end,\" or \"in order to do this,\" or \"for this purpose,\" etc., cannot be regarded as an unambiguous reference when moving from the English to the Chinese. Indeed, the English cites a different reason for Hitler's orders: \"To outdo the 1932 Los Angeles Games.\"\n\nEN: \"had a new...\"; CN: \"ordered that...\"\n\nEN: \"100,000-seat...stadium\"; CN: \"a...stadium [that] could hold 100,000 people\"",

When the investigation team arrived in Germany, it happened to coincide with the Nazi Party coming to power in 1933. Hitler reversed his previous attitude and announced \"full support for the Olympic Games.\" To this end, Hitler ordered the government to allocate 20 million marks (equivalent to 8 million US dollars at the time) to fund the Berlin Olympics and build the Berlin Olympic Stadium in Berlin that could accommodate 100,000 people. The government required artists to display the developed muscles and heroic strength of the Aryan race in sports posters, emphasizing the \"Aryan race superiority theory.\" The Olympics became a stage for Hitler and the Nazis to promote their political ideas."

  "premise": "According to Philip Lutgendorf, devotionalism to Hanuman and his theological significance emerged long after the composition of the Ramayana, in the 2nd millennium CE. His prominence grew after the arrival of Islamic rule in the Indian subcontinent. He is viewed as the ideal combination of shakti (\"strength, heroic initiative and assertive excellence\") and bhakti (\"loving, emotional devotion to his personal god Rama\"). Beyond wrestlers, he has been the patron god of other martial arts. He is stated to be a gifted grammarian, meditating yogi and diligent scholar. He exemplifies the human excellences of temperance, faith and service to a cause.",

    "comment": "The Chinese describes Lutgendorf as \"the American scholar known for his research on Hanuman.\" Of course, Lutgendorf has done research on Hanuman; otherwise, we would not find him cited in this passage. But, while the claim made in the Chinese that Lutgendorf's notoriety as a scholar stems from his work on Hanuman seems, on its face, convincing, there is not enough information given in the English to support it. However, we can infer from the English that Lutgendorf is a \"scholar\" (學者), as the Chinese puts it. \n\nIn Chinese, \"according to...\" (根據) cannot be left on its own; there must be a reference to the thing which is being referenced. So, the Chinese passage contains an \"extra\" term (說法), which means \"opinion,\" \"point of view,\" \"way of putting it,\" etc. In other words, in Chinese, there is no such thing as the form \"according to Lutgendorf, etc.\" Instead, there is something along the lines of: \"According to Lutgendorf's point of view/phrasing/speech/etc.\"\n\nHowever, there is a debatable claim put forth in the Chinese, debatable in that it appears to introduce an idea not mentioned in the English. The Chinese reads (beginning from \"在\"): \"after Islamic rule arrived in the Indian subcontinent, there emerged the worship of Hanuman.\" We know from the English that \"devotionalism to Hanuman\" emerged \"long after\" the composition of Ramayana, which occurred between roughly one thousand years ago and as recently as this year (going from the reference to the \"2nd millennium CE\" alone). Islam \"began\" about four hundred years before the advent of the second millennium. So, the claim that \"devotionalism,\" which we can pose as being roughly synonymous with \"worship\" (崇拜) toward Hanuman began after the arrival of Islamic rule in India appears not to be problematic. The question, though, is whether we can assume that the \"gr[owth]\" of Hanuman's \"prominence\" can be equated with the emergence of \"devotionalism\" toward Hanuman. This is arguable, so I am going to mark this segment as \"inferable.\" ",

The ganglia of the sympathetic nervous system are located between the first thoracic vertebrae and the second lumbar vertebrae (T1-L2), closer to the spine and farther away from the organs. The parasympathetic nervous system sends messages through the 3rd, 7th, 9th, and 10th cranial nerves and sacral spinal cord (S2, S3, S4). It has longer preganglionic neurons that are closer to the organs or distributed in the organs. The inner ganglion forms synapses with shorter postganglionic neurons."

The Chinese also mentions that she \"applied and enrolled in\" BYU; had she not applied, she could not have enrolled, so this is inferable. \n\nThe Chinese does mention that Morgan grew up in Arizona, but that information is presented in the context of her meeting her husband, who goes unmentioned in the English.",

The English begins, \"Numismatists have examples of coins from the earliest large-scale societies\"; the Chinese starts abruptly, having been excerpted incompletely: \"...discovered that multiple early large-scale societies had coins.\" In either case, if we know from the English that \"examples of coins\" exist that originate from \"the earliest large-scale societies,\" then we can infer that some \"early large-scale societies had coins.\" There is no contradiction here, except perhaps in the English text's reference to \"the earliest,\" compared to \"early,\" although in this direction (from English to Chinese), there is really no contradiction. Or in \"許多\" (many, multiple); although the English has \"societies,\" meaning a plurality (許多 can also mean \"a plurality,\" as a means of indicating more than one in a language in which plural and singular are not always obvious.

Though the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and other sources refers to this period as a fourth (\"post-monsoon\") season, other sources designate only three seasons.

This is corroborated later on in the English: \"the transition from wet to dry seasonal conditions\"; \"vegetation begins to dry out,\" meaning that it had to have been wet to begin with, before the \"post-monsoon...months.\" \n\nThe Chinese phrases the \"post-monsoon\" \"air masses\" in an inferable way: \"the winter, by contrast, has relatively dry seasonal winds.\" \n\nWe cannot know from the Chinese that southern India is hotter and more humid than northern India, although this is absolutely the case in reality.

This use of the book's universe was approved by Kipling at the request of Robert Baden-Powell, founder of the Scouting movement, who had originally asked for the author's permission for the use of the Memory Game from Kim in his scheme to develop the morale and fitness of working-class youths in cities. Akela, the head wolf in The Jungle Book, has become a senior figure in the movement; the name is traditionally adopted by the leader of each Cub Scout pack.",

    "comment": "It is difficult to argue there is any substantive information in the English that would support the opening claim in the Chinese: \"The Jungle Book became motivational reading for the Youth Scouts [Cub Scouts] (the children's stage of the Scouting movement because of [the book's] high moral/ethical content.\" While it seems natural that a book would not be promoted for young children to read, much less for the sake of \"motivating\" them, unless it had so-called \"high moral content,\" we are not informed in the English that this was the direct reason for the book's adoption by the Cub Scouts. Going in the other direction, as I will describe in the next paragraph's analysis, an inference can be made. \n\nThe Chinese passage mentions the adoption in scouting ceremonies of certain elements (in particular, the \"wolf howl\") from the Jungle Book. It also emphasizes Baden-Powell's modest intentions with Kipling's work, by emphasizing that Baden-Powell had originally \"merely requested\" the use of the \"memory game\" from Kipling's book Kim. \n\n\"Scheme\" is mentioned twice in the Chinese (it is 計畫).

  "text": "罗伯特·布里奇斯(Robert Bridges)发现了一个悖论：在谋杀邓肯一事上感到颇为恐怖的人，是不太可能去行凶的。 约翰·多佛·威尔逊John Dover Wilson在莎士比亚的原始文献上做出了推论，假设有一些附加场景，丈夫与妻子在其中讨论谋杀计划。 这种由野心驱动的邪恶行为导致他陷入了恶性循环，正如麦克白自己承认的那样：“我已经两足深陷于血泊之中，要是不再涉血前进，那么回头的路也是同样使人厌倦的。”",

  "premise": "Yet for other critics, it has not been so easy to resolve the question of Macbeth's motivation. Robert Bridges, for instance, perceived a paradox: a character able to express such convincing horror before Duncan's murder would likely be incapable of committing the crime. For many critics, Macbeth's motivations in the first act appear vague and insufficient. John Dover Wilson hypothesised that Shakespeare's original text had an extra scene or scenes where husband and wife discussed their plans. This interpretation is not fully provable; however, the motivating role of ambition for Macbeth is universally recognised. The evil actions motivated by his ambition seem to trap him in a cycle of increasing evil, as Macbeth himself recognises: \"I am in bloodStepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more, Returning were as tedious as go o'er.\"",

    "comment": "The Chinese notes that Bridges \"realized\" or \"discovered\" a paradox; but this is perfectly understandable in the context given by the English. \n\nThe Chinese describes Macbeth's horror in terms of its degree of intensity (\"felt such horror/quite a lot of horror\"), while the English describes the horror in terms of its convincingness. The ideas of \"express[ing] such convincing horror,\" as it is put in the English, and that of, \"feeling/experiencing such great horror,\" as it is put in the Chinese, appear to be slightly different. Of course, because we are talking about literature, the character's horror is expressed to the reader, such that the reader can perceive it. It is perhaps to be assumed that Macbeth's \"expression\" of horror reflects or stems from his genuine horror, that is his genuine sensation of horror, which is what the Chinese addresses. Nonetheless, there is certainly a different verb operating in the Chinese: 感. This verb, meaning \"perceive, feel, to move or be moved by,\" unambiguously relates to Macbeth's psychological state, while \"express\" unambiguously concerns the outward expression of that psychological state, which the reader might detect and interpret. \n\nUltimately both passages deal with the same question: How could a person apparently horrified by the prospect of murder end up carrying out such an act? Therefore, the difference in verbs is basically inconsequential. \n\nThe phrase \"committing the crime\" in the English corresponds with \"去行凶\" in the Chinese; I believe that here the term 凶 refers to murder; in the English \"the crime\" is a direct reference to murder, so there is nothing presented here that constitutes information that one could not not infer from the English.\n\nThe Chinese goes an extra step in laying out the background of John Dover Wilson's hypothesis (\"made/put forth a corollary/deduction [on the subject of ] Shakespeare's original works\"). The Chinese also specifies that the husband and wife \"discussed [their] plan to murder\" (谋杀计划).\n\nEN: \"a cycle of increasing evil\"; CN: \"a vicious circle\"\n\nThe Chinese, in translating Macbeth's quote, refers to \"a pool of blood\" (血泊), which is implied by the original English quotation (especially by the use of \"wade\"). \"So deeply\" is used in the Chinese instead of \"so far,\" but because we are talking about a metaphorical \"pool,\" we can assume that the farther one goes into the pool, the deeper the blood becomes. I do not think it is necessary to point out the use of \"deeply\" (深陷于) in the Chinese. \n\nThe English goes, \"...seem to trap him in a cycle,\" while the Chinese says, \"...cause him to become trapped in/to fall into\"; there is no substantive difference in meaning here. \n\n\"Tedious\" in the English corresponds to \"tiresome,\" \"wearisome\" in the Chinese (厌倦). The Chinese elaborates on \"returning\" (\"the road back\" 回头的路); this mention of \"road\" (路) is inferable. \n\nOne final note: While the English goes, \"would likely be incapable of...,\" the Chinese has it as: \"would not be likely to...\" or \"would be not be very capable of...\" (可能 can refer to capability or ability, and to probability or likelihood). I think the Chinese employs this phrasing to avoid using the term \"可能\" twice (where \"likely\" and \"incapable\" would both involve the use of 可能). ",

    "comment": "Chinese: Neo is \"shot to death\"; English: Neo is killed by Smith. This is partially new information (\"shot\" indicating the use of a firearm to kill Neo), but it is partially known information (Neo is killed). Because this unique meaning is contained in this single Chinese term, 擊斃, it is hard to determine new and inferable information. So, I am going to mark \"擊\" as the new information (as in, \"shoot\"); and 斃 as already-known information. Confusingly, the Chinese then notes that Neo exhibits the appearance of being \"on the verge of death.\"\nChinese: Trinity \"deeply kisses\" Neo; Neo is revived after having experienced the \"deep emotion...of the real world.\" Upon reviving, Neo has \"no doubt about his status as the \"Saver of the World\" (the One, I presume).\" Neo understands that he is capable of rewriting the Matrix's code. Neo \"invades\" Agent Smith's \"code,\" erasing/deleting him.  Smith explodes and turns into dust/ashes.\n",

There is more historical linguistic continuity or relation between English and Latin than there is between Chinese and Latin, although Chinese has in recent centuries absorbed and/or appropriated many Latin terms.

This is between 0.5 and 1% of adults in the developed world with between 5 and 50 per 100,000 people newly developing the condition each year. Onset is most frequent during middle age and women are affected 2.5 times as frequently as men. It resulted in 38,000 deaths in 2013, up from 28,000 deaths in 1990. The first recognized description of RA was made in 1800 by Dr. Augustin Jacob Landré-Beauvais (1772–1840) of Paris. The term rheumatoid arthritis is based on the Greek for watery and inflamed joints.",

    "comment": "The Chinese collapses the first two sentences of the English to an extent: It reads, \"Rheumatoid arthritis in 'already'- (已) developed countries affects about 0.5 to 1% of adults...\" \n\nWe know, from common sense, that \"the developed world\" is made up of \"developed countries,\" that is, \"countries that are already developed,\" (已開發國家). This Chinese expression strikes me as rather \"non-PRC\"-sounding. Indeed, the simplified Chinese Wikipedia article for \"developed country\" uses the term \"发达国家,\" which can be translated directly as \"developed countries.\" 发达 connotes a sense of maturity, while 開發 (开发 in simplified Chinese) connotes, in my opinion, an idea of \"prospecting,\" \"opening-up,\" or \"developing\" much in the sense of converting undeveloped land into marketable real estate. The traditional Chinese article uses the term “已開發.\" \n\nThe sense, conveyed in the English, that between 5 and 50 people per 100,000 develop the condition, representing people \"newly\" afflicted by rheumatoid arthritis each year, is not as clear in the Chinese (although the Chinese uses the verb phrase 罹患, which means something along the lines of \"contract\"/\"suffer from\").\n\nThe Chinese paragraph describes the \"first description\" of RA as occurring in \"Paris in 1800\"; the name of the describer (Dr. Landré-Beauvais) is missing from the Chinese.\n\n\"Rheumatoid arthritis\" is described by the English as being the \"original term\" for the condition, in addition to deriving from Greek.",

    "comment": "EN: \"deciduous forests\"; CN: \"temperate-zone deciduous broadleaf forests\"; \"needle-broadleaf mixed forests.\" \n\nWe know from the English that this animal lives at high altitudes (\"in the Himalayas\"), but we don't know what altitude range specifically. \n\nIt is unclear whether \"thornbrush forests\" corresponds to \"needleleaf forests.\" I am tempted to say that \"thornbrush forests\" corresponds more closely to the mention in the Chinese of \"subtropical arid river valley scrublands.\" But because there just isn't enough information to support this hunch solidly, I will not annotate the scrublands mention as inferable. On the other hand, \"mixed forests,\" especially when contrasted to \"deciduous forests,\" refers to forests with both deciduous and evergreen trees; therefore, mentions of \"needleleaf forests\" in the Chinese are inferable. Scrublands, however, do not conjure an image of \"forests\"; so that is another reason we should take caution when considering whether \"thornbrush forests\" corresponds to \"scrublands.\"\n\nThe Chinese notes that this animal has a migratory tendency; this can be inferred from the English (\"In the summer...; \"In winter...\"). Moreover, the Chinese notes: \"In the summer, it resides high in the mountains/on high mountains\"; the English observes: \"it usually inhabits altitudes of around in the Himalayas but rarely above,\" which, despite missing the critical piece of information that is the altitude range, we can conclude safely from the context (altitudes, Himalayas, rarely above) that we are talking about high elevations in the world's highest mountain range, the Himalayas. So, the Chinese statement is inferable. \n\nThe Chinese says of the animal's winter behavior: \"prior to the arrival of winter,\" (compared to \"In winter,\" in the English), \"it moves gradually from high elevations to relatively low-altitude areas.\" This information is mainly inferable (except for \"prior to\" and \"gradually\"); but the last portion is not inferable from the English (\"even [descending] to arid river valley scrublands\").

If there have been recipients of the Prize who violated the norm (of \"resistance toward the entry\" of persons or works connected to magazine to the competition for the Pulitzer Prize), then the norm could not have \"always\" been in operation. Although the English employs the term \"historically,\" we do come away from a reading of that passage with the sense that this was a norm that was \"usually\" at play, as the Chinese puts it. \n\nThe Chinese passage puts the order given in the English in reverse: Despite the norm, some outside the traditional scope of the Pulitzer Prize have been able to enter and even win the competition. There is some inferable information contained within the Chinese passage: \"winners\" becomes \"journalists or authors\" (记者或作家), \"eligible partnerships\" becomes \"collaborations with people\" (与人合作), and \"winners\" means that \"and on account of this, win the prize\" (并因此获奖) is inferable; one cannot be described as a \"winner\" of a contest (as the English puts it) unless one has \"won\" or \"been awarded\" (获) the prize (奖).

Although he left most of the game (including the distribution of letters) unchanged, Brunot slightly rearranged the \"premium\" squares of the board and simplified the rules; he also renamed the game Scrabble, a real word which means \"to scratch frantically\". In 1949, Brunot and his family made sets in a converted former schoolhouse in Dodgingtown, Connecticut, a section of Newtown. They made 2,400 sets that year but lost money. According to legend, Scrabbles big break came in 1952 when Jack Straus, president of Macy's, played the game on vacation. Upon returning from vacation, he was surprised to find that his store did not carry the game. He placed a large order, and within a year, \"everyone had to have one\".",

  "premise": "Hemingway was devastated on learning that Hadley had lost a suitcase filled with his manuscripts at the Gare de Lyon as she was traveling to Geneva to meet him in December 1922. In the following September the couple returned to Toronto, where their son John Hadley Nicanor was born on October 10, 1923. During their absence, Hemingway's first book, Three Stories and Ten Poems, was published. Two of the stories it contained were all that remained after the loss of the suitcase, and the third had been written early the previous year in Italy. Within months a second volume, in our time (without capitals), was published. The small volume included six vignettes and a dozen stories Hemingway had written the previous summer during his first visit to Spain, where he discovered the thrill of the corrida. He missed Paris, considered Toronto boring, and wanted to return to the life of a writer, rather than live the life of a journalist.",

    "comment": "Hemmingway's \"first book\" is described by the use of an idiomatic expression (處女座), 處女 meaning \"maiden,\" as in \"maiden voyage,\" but literally meaning \"virginal girl,\" which is also the definition of \"maiden\" in some cases. \n\nThe Hemmingways are described in the Chinese as \"staying\" in Toronto, which is inferable; they were there for at least ten days. Rather than describe John Hadley Nicanor's birth in terms of its place (Toronto), like the English, the Chinese describes it relative to time (\"it was at that time/during that time, that Hemmingway's first son was born,\" 就在那時，海明威的第一個兒子出生). We do not know from the English, though, that John was Hemmingway's \"first son,\" as the Chinese suggests (第一個兒子); but we can assume that he was \"Hemmingway's...son\" from the English (\"their son\"). \n\nThe Chinese describes Hemmingway's feeling that Toronto was \"dull\" (沈悶) differently from the English; the Chinese notes his perception that his job (工作) for the \"Star\" newspaper in Toronto was dull.

As Hemingway had to support the entire family's expenses, Hemingway gradually became busy and began to find his work at the Toronto Star boring, so he resigned on January 1, 1924. Most of Hemingway's works for the Star were later published in Dateline: Toronto in 1985."

This is hinted at by the English, which, by noting that \"he hosted Miami Underground\" in May 1960, seems to suggest that he hosted the show only for the duration of that month, or for a single program. The use of the \"-ing\" form of \"airing\" suggests continuity, but it is unclear whether the continuity implied thusly concerns the show itself or King's hosting of it. \n\nOn the other hand, the Chinese highlights the weekly frequency of the program (writing, literally, \"Beginning in May 1960, he on Channel 10 hosted the every Sunday at 11:30 PM broadcasting 'Miami Undercover'\"--in such a way that also does not seem to extend the continuity of the show to King's hosting of it. Nevertheless, the use of \"开始,\" meaning \"to begin,\" \"beginning in,\" etc., informs us that King did not host the show only in May of 1960, as might be concluded from the English. ",

M. Hare, and Peter Singer. The concept has been applied towards social welfare economics, questions of justice, the crisis of global poverty, the ethics of raising animals for food, and the importance of avoiding existential risks to humanity.",
