There is no known cure for CP, but supportive treatments, medication and surgery may help many individuals. This may include physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy. Medications such as diazepam, baclofen and botulinum toxin may help relax stiff muscles. Surgery may include lengthening muscles and cutting overly active nerves. Often, external braces and Lycra splints and other assistive technology are helpful with mobility. Some affected children can achieve near normal adult lives with appropriate treatment.

    "comment": "The Chinese takes a bit of a logical leap, suggesting that CP can be \"prevented\" (預防) by \"having\" the pregnant mother \"receive\" immunization shots. The English merely suggests that \"some of the causes of CP are preventable\" through this method.\n\nThe Chinese then states explicitly that \"preventing children from injuring their head\" \"can also achieve preventative effects,\" while the latter idea (that of prevention) is implied in the English, having already been laid out explicitly in the previous clause. \n\nEN: \"There is no known cure for CP\"; CN: \"Currently there is no means of completely curing (完全治療) CP\"\n\nThe Chinese then refers to individuals afflicted by CP with \"different conditions/statuses\" (不同病況). \n\nThere is a missing period that should go after \"緊繃的肌肉\"; and after \"生活\" and before \"常常.\"\n\nEN: \"Surgery may include\"; CN: \"The surgery that can be implemented includes\" (會進行的手術包括, where 手術 means \"surgery\").\n\nThe Chinese suggests that \"frequently, patients elect to use alternative medicines\"; this is mainly inferable, with the exception of \"patients\"; we cannot know from the English alone that the use of alternative medicines to treat CP is determined by patients in most cases, as opposed to by doctors, parents, or other stakeholders in the patients' treatment. The Chinese continues: \"but for these treatment courses there is no research whatsoever (任何, meaning, \"any,\" \"at all,\" etc.) to support their usefulness.\" Nothing here strikes the reader as information that could not be inferred from the Chinese. Perhaps \"usefulness\" connotes something slightly different than does \"use,\" but if research supports the use of some therapy, then it can be assumed that the research has indicated that that therapy is in someway \"useful\" (實用).\n\n\n\n ",

I was a bit puzzled by the first sentence because the sequence of the sentence is not the same as the original, so instead of presidents being asked by citizens, it talks about citizens writing to the presidents. I worked according to my understanding of the rules, and here is my reasoning: 乌克兰 - Ukrainian (citizens) - infered from the context. 提供 - provide (help) - infered from them asking for help is therefore wanting someone to provide help. 时 - at the time - which is in 2012. 甚至 - even - infered from the amount of letters he receives.

Radar technology has already appeared with ground-to-air, air-to-ground (search) bombing, air-to-air (interception) fire control, and identification of friend or foe. After World War II, radar developed single pulse angle tracking, pulse Doppler signal processing, high resolution of synthetic aperture and pulse compression, combined system combined with identification of friend or foe, automatic fire control system combined with computer, terrain avoidance and terrain following, Passive or active phased array, frequency agility, multi-target detection and tracking and other new radar systems."

It was composed by Joong-sam Yun and appears as music in the music library of most Samsung phones released since 2011. Prior to 2011, \"Beyond Samsung\" served as Samsung's trademark music track, while \"Samsung Tune\" was used as the default ringtone. The sound appears as the default ringtone, as well as the sound when the phone turns on or off (a snippet is used), and as a notification sound. While the basic composition of the six-note tune has not changed since its inception, various versions of different genres have been introduced as the product line evolved.",

    "comment": "EN: \"'Over the Horizon' is the trademark sound for Samsung smartphone devices\"; CN: \"...is Samsung electronic's (smart devices) brand theme ringtone.\" So, we can infer, moving from the Chinese to the English, that the sound would also relate to Samsung smartphones; but we cannot infer from the English to the Chinese that all Samsung \"smart\" devices have the same ringtone. \n\nThe Chinese notes that Yun \"conceived of\" (构想) the ringtone, while the English credits him with having \"composed\" it. Whoever composes a piece of music most likely conceived of it, so this is inferable. \n\nThere is not enough information to infer from the English that Yun was, as the Chinese states, a \"Samsung employee\" (三星员工). \n\nThe Chinese distinguishes the \"original version\" of the composition from the \"shortened\" and \"remixed\" version used as the ringtone; the English makes no distinction, only noting that different variations of the original have been \"introduced.\"\n\nThe Chinese also describes the \"six notes\" that comprise the ringtone, notes that they \"ascend and descend,\" says that the original, full version of the ringtone can be found inside the phone's software, and that it has remained despite the introduction of a new brand theme by Samsung in 2021.

It includes device power on and off, default notification ringtones and The default incoming call ringtone is used. The ascending and descending scale composed of the six tones \"Do Do Sol Do↑ Si Sol\" is used as the main axis of the melody. The original version was conceived by Samsung employee Josh Joongsam Yun. Although the incoming call ringtone is a shortened version And remixed, but the corresponding full version can be found in the device folder; even though Samsung launched a new brand theme ringtone in 2021, it is still retained."

Icy Europa's mysterious double ridges may hint at hidden pockets of water . If confirmed, the lakes and pockets of water could be yet another potential habitat for life. Evidence suggests that hydrogen peroxide is abundant across much of the surface of Europa. Because hydrogen peroxide decays into oxygen and water when combined with liquid water, the authors argue that it could be an important energy supply for simple life forms.",

It is the least dangerous form (low mortality with treatment, 23.7% mortality without). Cutaneous anthrax presents as a boil-like skin lesion that eventually forms an ulcer with a black center (eschar). The black eschar often shows up as a large, painless, necrotic ulcer (beginning as an irritating and itchy skin lesion or blister that is dark and usually concentrated as a black dot, somewhat resembling bread mold) at the site of infection. In general, cutaneous infections form within the site of spore penetration between two and five days after exposure. Unlike bruises or most other lesions, cutaneous anthrax infections normally do not cause pain. Nearby lymph nodes may become infected, reddened, swollen, and painful. A scab forms over the lesion soon, and falls off in a few weeks.",

  "translation3": "Cutaneous anthrax infection develops within 1 to 2 weeks. It initially appears as nuisance, itchy skin lesions or black dot-like blisters, similar to the black mold that appears on bread after being left out for a long time, and then develops into large, painless, necrotic ulcers. Cutaneous anthrax does not cause any pain compared to ordinary bruises or most other skin injuries. If left untreated, it has a 20% fatality rate. Although it is lower than other forms of anthrax, it is still very high in medical statistics. , but there is almost no danger after treatment."

Writing to spiritualist journal Light that year, he declared himself to be a spiritualist, describing one particular event that had convinced him psychic phenomena were real. Also in 1887 (on 26 January), he was initiated as a Freemason at the Phoenix Lodge No. 257 in Southsea. (He resigned from the Lodge in 1889, returned to it in 1902, and resigned again in 1911.)",

It earned over $782 million against a $58 million budget, becoming the ninth-highest grossing film of 2016 and breaking numerous records, including the highest-grossing R-rated film at the time. Critics praised Reynolds' performance, the film's style and faithfulness to the comics, along with its action sequences, though some criticized the plot as formulaic and were divided on the film's adult humor. It received many awards and nominations, including two Critics' Choice awards and two Golden Globe nominations.",

Some lithotrophs can even use the energy contained in sulfur compounds to produce sugars, a process known as chemosynthesis.

    "comment": "The Chinese begins by providing a broad definition of, I assume, \"paganism.\" A narrower definition follows, then \"the most narrow\" use for the term is given (referring to \"European non-abrahamic folk religions,\" especially originating from \"Germanic, Northern European, Celtic, Slavic, Greek and Southern European\" peoples.\n\n\"modernized religions rooted in these European-originating religions,\" the Chinese passage notes, may also be described as (presumably) \"pagan.\" \n\nWe might get the sense from the English that the religious or spiritual movements it describes are \"modernized\" (现代化), as the Chinese states. Of these, the Chinese and English only overlap on \"Wicca\" (威卡教). Nonetheless, the English includes the terms: \"revival,\" \"contemporary liberal values,\" and the use of \"focuses,\" being a verb in the present tense--these all hint at a contemporary context. The Chinese does not explicitly refer to a contemporary context, but by using the term \"modern\" or \"modernized\" (现代化), implies that these new or derivative religious movements are being practiced today. \n\nThis is a bit of a stretch, but I am going to come down on the side of \"现代化\" being inferable. \n\nFurthermore, the idea of these being \"new\" religions, as the Chinese suggests: 新宗教 literally meaning \"new religions,\" is perhaps implied in the English, which notes that these \"contemporary\" practices constitute a \"revival\" of preexisting traditions, but introduce new elements (namely, \"contemporary liberal values\"). That is, the faiths that emerged from the pagan revival movement may constitute \"new\" religions, in the sense that they incorporate new elements, and are thus different from the tradition that serve as their foundation. Because this point is arguable, I am going to label \"新宗教\" as \"inferable.\"\n\nThe Chinese lists some of these \"new religions\" (新宗教): \"Wicca, the Germanic neo-paganism/neo-heathenry movement, etc.\"\nAside from Wicca, I am unsure if this section includes \"inferable\" information. As far as I'm concerned, there is nothing inherent to the term \"Heathenry\" that links it, without the need for explanation, to the idea of \"Germanic.\" \n\nWe do know that the Chinese references to \"European folk [religion]\" (which are identifiable as \"欧洲民族\" and \"民族原生宗教\") are inferable; all of the listed examples given in the English are inferably European in origin. Indeed, we know that Druids resided in \"northern Europe\" (北欧), were Celts (卡尔特), and \"Slavic Native Faith\" adherents were Slavs (斯拉夫). ",

The town became the site of a royal palace, the Palace of Placentia from the 15th century, and was the birthplace of many Tudors, including Henry VIII and Elizabeth I. The palace fell into disrepair during the English Civil War and was demolished to be replaced by the Royal Naval Hospital for Sailors, designed by Sir Christopher Wren and his assistant Nicholas Hawksmoor. These buildings became the Royal Naval College in 1873, and they remained a military education establishment until 1998 when they passed into the hands of the Greenwich Foundation.

The last wild individual in Vietnam was shot in 2010. Javan Rhinoceros Rhinoceros are also the least known of the rhino species, and their main threat is from hunters poaching their horns. The body length including its head can reach 2 to 4 meters (6.6 to 13.1 feet), the height can reach 1.4-1.7 meters (4.6-5.8 feet), and the weight is 900-2300 kilograms."

  "premise": "Most Aloe species have a rosette of large, thick, fleshy leaves. Aloe flowers are tubular, frequently yellow, orange, pink, or red, and are borne, densely clustered and pendant, at the apex of simple or branched, leafless stems. Many species of Aloe appear to be stemless, with the rosette growing directly at ground level; other varieties may have a branched or unbranched stem from which the fleshy leaves spring. They vary in color from grey to bright-green and are sometimes striped or mottled. Some aloes native to South Africa are tree-like (arborescent).",

    "comment": "The leaves are said in the Chinese to be evergreen (常绿), \"thick and juicy/succulent,\" with \"spikes/thorns along the edges,\" and long, pointed/sharp leaves. \"Juicy/succulent\" is arguably inferable from the \"thick, fleshy\" description found in the English. \"Fleshy\" implies a degree of pliability or cushiness that would suggest the presence of fluid. \n\nThe leaves are said to be \"long and pointed/sharp,\" which I argue cannot be deduced from the English. Moreover, the leaves are said to be \"grass-green\" in color. The color range given in the English--\"grey to bright-green\"--would suggest that leaf coloration falls in a broadly green range, but the statement that their color is \"grass-green\" cannot be supported by the description given in the English. \n\nThe Chinese indicates that the aloe plant flowers in summer and fall. \n\nI have marked as inferable the Chinese paragraph's description of the flowers as a \"raceme\" (总状花序) and explication thereof, because, upon searching for a definition of this term, I have found it to be concordant with the description in the English. \n\nFlowers are described as \"yellow\" in color (not, as the English suggests, \"frequently yellow, orange, pink, or red\"). \n\nFinally, the Chinese describes the seed capsules of the aloe plant.

The lungs are part of respiratory system which helps to maintain acid–base homeostasis by regulating carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in the blood. The respiratory system is the first line of defense when the body experiences and acid–base problem. It attempts to return the body pH to a value of 7.4 by controlling the respiratory rate. When the body is experiencing acidic conditions, it will increase the respiratory rate which in turn drives off CO2 and decreases the H+ concentration, therefore increasing the pH. In basic conditions, the respiratory rate will slow down so that the body holds onto more CO2 and increases the H+ concentration and decreases the pH.",

The Chinese informs us that adults' intestines range between six and seven meters in length, but due to muscle contraction, that length can shorten to three to four meters. This range in length is not only attributed to a different cause than the English (muscle contraction/tightness in the Chinese, and measuring technique and height of the person in the English), but is omitted entirely from the English passage, so it is unreasonable to mark any of the Chinese information as inferable. Moreover, the information that might be inferable given the above discussion is diffused throughout the Chinese passage; it cannot be labelled coherently, in my opinion. For instance, that a range in length exists is inferable from the English, but the Chinese quantifies the range to an extent that the connection to the English becomes tenuous. ",

After three years of studies there, Donne was admitted to the University of Cambridge, where he studied for another three years. Donne could not obtain a degree from either institution because of his Catholicism, since he refused to take the Oath of Supremacy required to graduate. In 1591 he was accepted as a student at the Thavies Inn legal school, one of the Inns of Chancery in London. On 6 May 1592, he was admitted to Lincoln's Inn, one of the Inns of Court.",

  "translation3": "Her mother's relative Thomas More was martyred for Catholicism, and many close relatives suffered persecution. Her younger brother Henry was also imprisoned and killed for religious reasons. He studied theology, medicine, law and classics at Hart Hall (now Hertford College, Oxford University) and Cambridge University, but did not obtain a degree in either. Later, he was appreciated by James I for writing articles attacking Catholicism and safeguarding the royal power. He became a royal priest in 1615 and the dean of St. Paul's Cathedral in 1621. He was the most famous missionary at that time until his death in 1631."

Thus, the entire claim (including parts of it that we know, such as \"Wellington\" and \"work\") must be labelled as \"new\" information that could not be inferred. \n\nWe know that Key later worked at Bankers Trust, but we don't know, as the Chinese notes, that he did so \"for a time\"--nor could we guess as much, because the English ends here, without describing his later work experience. \n",

John Key worked for Bankers Trusts for a time before moving to Singapore and London to work for Merrill Lynch, where some colleagues called him the \"Smiley Face Assassin\" ().

Astrium was involved in developing a European Space Agency plan for a sample return mission to Mars, as part of the ESA's Aurora programme, and sending a mission to Phobos with its low gravity was seen as a good opportunity for testing and proving the technologies required for an eventual sample return mission to Mars. The mission was envisioned to start in 2016, was to last for three years. The company planned to use a \"mothership\", which would be propelled by an ion engine, releasing a lander to the surface of Phobos. The lander would perform some tests and experiments, gather samples in a capsule, then return to the mothership and head back to Earth where the samples would be jettisoned for recovery on the surface.

That is to say, in the English, it is clear that the report and the activity by Astrium both occurred in 2007. In the Chinese, on the other hand, it is unclear (ignoring the citation at the end) if the events coincided in 2007; all we know is that Astrium was \"planning\" \"in 2007.\" \nCorresponding to the second sentence in the English paragraph, the Chinese says that Astrium is \"currently involved in developing...\"\nThe \"lander\" (陆器) is referred to earlier in the Chinese than it is in the English.",

In 1905, Einstein's cautious expression of the mass–energy relationship allowed for the possibility that \"dormant\" mass might exist that would remain behind after all the energy of a body was removed. By 1907, however, Einstein was ready to assert that all inertial mass represented a reserve of energy. \"To equate all mass with energy required an act of aesthetic faith, very characteristic of Einstein.\" Einstein's bold hypothesis has been amply confirmed in the years subsequent to his original proposal.",

If the experimental fact that \"the speed of light in vacuum is independent of the reference system\" is accepted as the basic principle, a new space-time theory (relativistic space-time theory) can be established. In 1905, Einstein published a paper \"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\", establishing the special theory of relativity and successfully describing the motion of macroscopic objects in the sub-light speed field."

Moreover, apart from the reference to \"Lincoln Square Academy,\" which we might associate with the arts due to Lincoln Square's being the location of Lincoln Center, we cannot assume that the reader would be able to make the association to Laurence Fishburne from the content of the passage (although, of course, he is probably the best-known person with that surname). Therefore, \"Laurence\" (勞倫斯) must be annotated as \"new information.\" \n\nTo be very particular, while the English uses \"graduate\" as a noun, referring to a person who has graduated from a school, the Chinese uses \"graduate\" in the verb sense; he \"graduated from Lincoln Square Academy.\" \n\nAs an aside, there is no identical way in Chinese of expressing \"which...,\" as in English. Therefore, in the Chinese, rather than express the idea \"Lincoln Square Academy in New York, which closed in the 1980s\" exactly as it is rendered in English, a reference must be made to the school again in the final clause: \"the/that school\" (該學院) \"in the 1980s closed.\"",

The Chinese entry begins with: \"El Lahun has the Pyramid of Senusret II,\" which is an idea slightly different, but not contradictory to, that which the English begins with.\nThe Chinese describes its builders' actions as having \"cleverly used its foundation...\" etc. I think this idea is inferable, because the English describes how the builders \"reduced the amount of work necessary to construct it,\" suggesting that their technique was ingenious or creative. This idea (reducing the amount of work necessary), it is worth noting, is also mentioned explicitly in the last segment of the Chinese paragraph (beginning with 大量). \nThe Chinese is ambiguous about what the builders actually did. The Chinese says: \"its builders cleverly used its construction foundation core--a twelve-meter-high natural limestone hill.\" That is to say, it does not indicate clearly what the builders did with or to this hill. I am dubious about this discrepancy; it seems unlikely for there to be such a major writing error. So, I am giving it the benefit of the doubt and not marking it as new information. ",

Michio Suzuki was intent on making better, more user-friendly looms and, for 30 years his focus was on the development of these machines. Michio's desire to diversify into automotive products was interrupted by World War II. Before it began building four-stroke engines, Suzuki Motor Corp. was known for its two-stroke engines (for motorcycles and autos). After the war, Suzuki made a two-stroke motorized bicycle, but eventually the company would be known for Hayabusa and GSX-R motorcycles, for the QuadRunner, and for dominating racetracks around the world. Even after producing its first car in 1955 the company didn't have an automobile division until 1961. Today Suzuki is among the world's largest automakers, and a major brand name in important markets, including Japan and India, but no longer sells cars in North America.",

This is pretty tenuous, though, so while I am going to label it as \"inferable,\" it really is only inferable if you have some background about \"quads.\" I do not know, however, whether four-wheelers/quads are described as \"off-road vehicles\" in Chinese-language parlance.\n\nThe Chinese notes that Suzuki is the brand with the greatest share of the automotive market in \"countries [with] emerging/developing economies,\" such as \"India\" and \"Southeast Asia.\" All we know from the English, though, is that India is an \"important market.\" Although India is a developing economy, because the English pairs India with Japan (a developed economy) under the category of \"important markets,\" I am choosing not to label this information as \"inferable.\" ",

  "premise": "Though there have been several definitions of \"voluntary\" and \"involuntary unemployment\" in the economics literature, a simple distinction is often applied. Voluntary unemployment is attributed to the individual's decisions, but involuntary unemployment exists because of the socio-economic environment (including the market structure, government intervention, and the level of aggregate demand) in which individuals operate. In these terms, much or most of frictional unemployment is voluntary since it reflects individual search behavior. Voluntary unemployment includes workers who reject low-wage jobs, but involuntary unemployment includes workers fired because of an economic crisis, industrial decline, company bankruptcy, or organizational restructuring.",

    "comment": "The reasoning given for cyclical unemployment's being categorized as \"involuntary unemployment\"--\"people are able and willing to work, but society's overall demand declines“ would support an inferred understanding of cyclical unemployment, although this term is absent from the English. \n\nThe Chinese discusses \"cyclical unemployment,\" which it suggests \"is grouped with involuntary unemployment.\" The English does not mention \"cyclical unemployment,\" but does discuss \"frictional unemployment\" and \"involuntary unemployment.\" If involuntary unemployment encapsulates \"cyclical unemployment,\" and if \"involuntary unemployment\" is, as the English tells us, germane to the field of economics, then it could be inferred that cyclical unemployment, as a type of involuntary unemployment, would be a subject of interest and study by economists (albeit, the Chinese goes further, saying that this is a major research topic).\n\nI have labelled as inferable the sample of methods proposed by economists to alleviate involuntary unemployment (\"workers or labor unions voluntarily lower their pay; increase the attractiveness of investment in enterprises and increase overall demand; use of fiscal policy by the government to supplement insufficient private investment to make up for the disparity in overall demand; etc.\")--these methods intuitively correspond to the list of causes of involuntary unemployment given in the English, which are \"economic crisis, industrial decline, company bankruptcy, or organizational restructuring.\" Admittedly, the latter cause is not as clearly reflected in the list of possible solutions.

This kind of unemployment is classified as involuntary unemployment, because people are able and willing to work, but the total demand of society is reduced to labor. How to solve cyclical unemployment has always been a key research object of economists. The economics community has proposed several methods. Methods, for example: workers or trade unions voluntarily reduce wages; increase investment inducement in the corporate sector to increase aggregate demand; the government uses fiscal policy to supplement the lack of private investment and fill the gap with aggregate demand, etc."

The Chinese phrase is mostly translated back to magazines, and another phrase - 日志 - works better in this scenario. However, put the word \"journal\" in google translate, and 杂志 is the first choice that it uses. I guess from a human's standpoint, I had to highlight it. However, if we are looking for the most perfectly machine translated text, you can ignore that phrase. ",

  "premise": "The breeding season for sloth bears varies according to location: in India, they mate in April, May, and June, and give birth in December and early January, while in Sri Lanka, it occurs all year. Sows gestate for 210 days, and typically give birth in caves or in shelters under boulders. Litters usually consist of one or two cubs, or rarely three. Cubs are born blind, and open their eyes after four weeks. Sloth bear cubs develop quickly compared to most other bear species: they start walking a month after birth, become independent at 24–36 months, and become sexually mature at the age of three years. Young cubs ride on their mother's back when she walks, runs, or climbs trees until they reach a third of her size. Individual riding positions are maintained by cubs through fighting. Intervals between litters can last two to three years.",

    "comment": "The English uses a sex-specifying term to describe the female sloth bear, while the Chinese refers to female sloth bears directly (\"雌性懒熊\"). \n\nThe English does not specify what proportion of the overall sloth bear population is found in India and Sri Lanka, respectively. Thus, it is unclear whether the case for India--that bears \"give birth in December and early January\"--or that for Sri Lanka--\"it occurs all year\"--represents the case for the majority of bears, and therefore the \"typical\" breeding behavior of the bears. This is relevant to the claim in the Chinese that the bears \"generally give birth between December and January of the following year,\" because we do not know which of the two aforementioned ranges (for India and Sri Lanka, respectively) to treat as \"typical.\" Thus, I have labelled \"一般\" (meaning \"generally\") as \"new\" information, and the remainder of the phrase as \"inferable.\"\n\nCN: \"The place of birth of sloth bear cubs is typically...\"; EN: \"Sows...typically give birth in...\"\n\nThe Chinese describes the relative quickness of movement of sloth bears compared to other species of bear. This information is not found anywhere in the English.\n\nThe Chinese notes that the bear cubs \"compete for space and even fight\" \"in order to grab a [firm] hold of their mother\" while riding on her back.

However, the Chinese includes a measurement for height including the head (without specifying the sex of impala for which that measurement applies). Nonetheless, we can say, therefore, that the Chinese description of female height being \"at the shoulder\" could be inferable. In the final analysis, the data missing from the English (\"Males reach approximately at the shoulder, while females are tall\") means that we cannot annotate the shoulder specification of the height measurement for females given by the Chinese as \"inferable.\"\n\nCN, regarding horns: \"partly curved/crooked/bent\"; EN, regarding horns: \"lyre-shaped,\" \"arch-like\"--both descriptions seem to be in accord, and it can be deduced from both that the horns are not straight. The CN does describe the horns as \"bow-shaped,\" rather than \"arch-like,\" but the idea is more or less the same. ",

It is worth mentioning that this second bye home run helped the same team. The closer Rivera was qualified to win the game, and it was Rivera who suffered the bye home run more than 4 years ago. Ichiro's two bye home runs were both related to Rivera."

  "translation3": "In terms of ethics, Kant denies that the will is controlled by external factors, but believes that the will is innate rather than acquired. Kant believes that true moral behavior is behavior based purely on obligation, and doing things to achieve a certain personal utilitarian purpose cannot be considered a moral behavior. Therefore, Kant believed that whether an action is moral or not depends not on the consequences of the action, but on the motivation for taking the action. Kant also believes that we are free only when we abide by moral laws, because we abide by the moral rules we have formulated ourselves, and if we do it just because we want to do it, there is no freedom at all, because you become A slave to all things."

  "premise": "In 1818 the Nantucket whaleship Globe, under Captain George Washington Gardner, discovered a \"mother lode\" of sperm whales some thousand miles west of the South American coast approximately at the equator. He returned to Nantucket in 1820 with more than 2,000 barrels of sperm whale oil and the news of his discovery. This led to an influx of whaleships to exploit the new whaling ground and the Galápagos Islands became a frequent stop for the whalers both before and after visiting what came to be known as the Offshore Grounds. This led to the establishment in the Galápagos Islands of a kind of unofficial \"post office\" where whaleships stopped to pick up and drop off letters as well as for provisioning and repairing. ",

In 1820, he returned to Nantucket, the center of the world's whaling industry, with more than 2,000 barrels of sperm whale oil and new discoveries. This new discovery caused a large number of whaling ships to flock to the new whaling grounds code-named \"Offshore Grounds\". The Galapagos Islands became a hotspot for whaling ships on their voyages back and forth, and the islands even had a sort of informal post office where the whaling fleets could send and receive letters, as well as supply and repair their ships."

By 1909, Lowell and William H. Pickering had suggested several possible celestial coordinates for such a planet. Lowell and his observatory conducted his search until his death in 1916, but to no avail. Unknown to Lowell, his surveys had captured two faint images of Pluto on March 19 and April 7, 1915, but they were not recognized for what they were. There are fourteen other known precovery observations, with the earliest made by the Yerkes Observatory on August 20, 1909.",

    "comment": "The Chinese does not suggest (as the English does) that \"Planet X\" (X行星) was a name coined by Lowell. \n\nIn other words, technically speaking, Lowell was not searching for Planet X per se, but for the hypothesized ninth planet of the solar system, which he referred to as \"Planet X.\"\n\nEN: \"his surveys\"; CN: \"the cosmic/astronomical surveys\" (巡天)\n\nThe Chinese claims that Lowell's surveys captured \"two...photographs\" on March 19, 1915 alone, while the English implies that one photograph was captured on March 19, and another on April 7; therefore, although the highlighted segment (两张, meaning \"two [followed by a measure word used for photographs, 张)\" is not \"new\" in itself, the claim that it produces is new, in that it contradicts information given in the English. \n\nAlso, the English does not specify that the images of Pluto were captured on or by photographs (照片), but it is inferable (and appears in the Chinese) that such was the case. Moreover, because the Chinese refers to the medium (photographs) on which the images were captured, there is a slight difference in the way the images are described. The English reads: \"captured two faint images of Pluto,\" while the Chinese reads, literally, \"photographed two photos containing blurry images of Pluto.\"\n\nThese \"images\" (图像) are then invoked by name (这些图像并没有被...), while in the English they are referred to by the use of \"they.\"\n\nEN: \"other known\"; CN: \"there are also...of this kind\" (此类 meaning \"of this type/kind\"). Again, while these images are referred to in the English as \"observations,\" the Chinese calls them \"photographs\" (照片).",

  "premise": "The war demonstrated the failure of the Qing dynasty's attempts to modernize its military and fend off threats to its sovereignty, especially when compared with Japan's successful Meiji Restoration. For the first time, regional dominance in East Asia shifted from China to Japan; the prestige of the Qing dynasty, along with the classical tradition in China, suffered a major blow. The humiliating loss of Korea as a tributary state sparked an unprecedented public outcry. Within China, the defeat was a catalyst for a series of political upheavals led by Sun Yat-sen and Kang Youwei, culminating in the 1911 Xinhai Revolution.",

    "comment": "The English passage, because of how it is excerpted, does not refer to the war being discussed in the first sentence by name, while the Chinese does (甲午战争), the (first) Sino-Japanese War. \n\nAlthough the Chinese passage begins with a segment that is omitted from the English, we can regard the references in the former to \"the Qing military's...failure/loss\" (清军...的失败) as inferable; we know from the English that under discussion is a \"war\" (involving, as they always do, militaries), and one in which the Qing had failed to \"fend off threats....\" So, it is nearly certain that the Qing military suffered a defeat in this war (which is true, in fact). \n\nThis defeat is described in the Chinese as \"signifying [the Qing's] massive decline in global standing\"; this is consonant with the idea, conveyed in the English, that the Qing's failure in the war resulted in \"the prestige of the Qing dynasty...[suffering] a major blow.\"\n\nThe Chinese uses an idiomatic expression (鲸吞蚕食的对象) meaning, roughly, \"a target for being swallowed whole [like a whale does] and nibbled away at [like silkworms do],\" which is clearly a reference to China's weakened sovereignty--the Qing empire was repeatedly cajoled into giving up its territory and resources to foreign powers. So, this expression is inferable (we know from the English that the Qing's poor performance in the war had to do in part with its inability to \"fend off threats to its sovereignty.\" \n\nThe Chinese contains an additional reference to the Qing's decline in international status (\"此役...直下\"). The rise of Japan is mentioned, too--another inferable bit of information (EN: \"regional dominance in East Asia shifted from China to Japan). This shift in power vis-a-vis East Asia, indeed, reflects Japan's ascension to the ranks of the \"powers\" or \"great powers\" (列强之一). \n\nEN: \"...a catalyst for a series of political upheavals...\"; CN: \"hastened/catalyzed later reforms to the political system.\" The Chinese then lists a number of such political reforms; but their status as political reforms triggered, in part, by the Qing's defeat in the Sino-Japanese War is not apparent without background knowledge.

At the same time, the Sino-Japanese War also marked the failure of the Westernization Movement. After this battle, China's international status plummeted, while Japan became one of the great powers. The terms of the Treaty of Shimonoseki exploited China and inspired Chinese intellectuals to reflect on the national conditions. The reform parties within the Qing government had a deeper understanding of their own weaknesses, which promoted the subsequent reform of the political system, namely the 1898 Reform Movement of 1898, the forerunner of the Hundred Days Reform."

However, importance (重要) was mentioned earlier in the Chinese sentence, so you can also argue that it is inferable, which is why I highlighted 占 and 位 as inferable, but I can see people arguing from the other angle too.

    "comment": "The first sentence of the Chinese introduces totally new information: 60% of spotted hyenas' diets comes from [food] pilfered from [kills made by] cheetahs. Information about hyenas' famously human-like \"laugh\" is also given. That hyenas \"laugh\" is well-known, but the information simply is not in the English. \n\nThe English claims that hyenas are \"generally\" \"known to drive off larger predators,\" while the Chinese states that they are \"known to\" \"be capable of driving off....\" In my opinion, the Chinese treats this behavior of hyenas somewhat more modestly. The English notes that the hyena has \"a reputation in popular culture for being cowardly,\" while the Chinese reads: \"people often think that hyenas are cowardly.\" The difference is purely semantic and whatever new information is conveyed by the Chinese here is perfectly inferable. \n\nEN: \"drive off larger predators...from their kills\"; CN: \"drive off larger predators...from stealing/pilfering their kills\" (\"stealing/pilfering\" 偷盗 is inferable).\n\nThe Chinese notes that spotted hyenas may live in groups (群居) and hunt in groups (群猎). I think that the latter, which reads as incongruent to the English reader because hyenas are notorious scavengers, and because the English claims only that hyenas may \"congregate at kills\" (in other words, once the hunt is already over), may be a tic of Chinese syntax, which may include \"the kill\" as part of \"the hunt\" per se, rather than as the outcome of or an event following the hunt. \n\nIn any case, the spotted hyena is contrasted in the English to the less \"gregarious\" majority of hyena varieties, so we might take the attributes that are considered atypical for most hyenas (living in family groups and congregating at kills) and invert them to infer the behavior of the \"highly social spotted hyena.\" Thus, the Chinese description of the spotted hyena's \"culture\" of living in groups and hunting together may be inferred. \n\nEN: \"Hyenas are generally not gregarious animals\"; CN: \"the majority of hyenas are not social animals\"; CN: \"because of a kill, congregate\" vs. EN: \"congregate at kills\"",

It says: \"The \"milk soups\" of European cuisine mainly use cow's milk or cream.\" Because the second sentence of the English describes \"traditional East Asian soups\" as being thin, brothy, \"clear\" or otherwise not thick and creamy (which are characteristics of \"milk soups\"), the description of East Asian soups appear to put them in distinction to a different, non-East Asian standard of soups. But because this is so tenuous, I have not labelled it as inferable. ",

He hoped to keep Russia in the war by convincing the Bolsheviks that they would receive a better peace from the Allies, to bolster Allied morale, and to undermine German war support. The address was well received in the United States and Allied nations and even by Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin, as a landmark of enlightenment in international relations. Wilson subsequently used the Fourteen Points as the basis for negotiating the Treaty of Versailles, which ended the war.",

    "comment": "The Chinese argues that the \"Fourteen Points 'peace principles' represent Wilson's political idealism.\" For one, although we see the Fourteen Points referred to in the English merely by that name, we know that this document, or accord, had to do with \"peace,\" especially the settlement of the First World War--we know it was that particular war, in turn, for a number of reasons, but particularly because Woodrow Wilson was the president in 1918.\n\nMoreover, the context of diplomacy, international agreements, and presidential action suggest that this is Wilson's \"political idealism\" that is being referred to. \n\nAs for \"represent\" (代表), if Wilson's \"idealism pervaded\" the document, then the document strongly reflected Wilson's idealism; in that case, the document itself likely \"represented\" his idealism; one would not inject, whether intentionally or not, one's ideals into a document with which one's ideals were opposed in the first place. For instance, a \"peace treaty\" drafted by a notoriously bellicose, bloodthirsty warlord could not resound with his \"ideals,\" because \"peace\" is not among them. Therefore, it could not \"represent\" his ideals, either, because a peace document is antithetical, as an object, to his modus operandi and ideals, which would be better encapsulated in a declaration of war. \n\nLenin's perspective on the value of the Fourteen Points is reflected in the apparently neutral description put forth in the Chinese (也造就国际联盟...).",

Albert believed that Aristotle's approach to natural philosophy did not pose any obstacle to the development of a Christian philosophical view of the natural order.",

Instead, he went to Romanian composer and violinist George Enescu, under whose tutelage he made recordings with several piano accompanists, including his sister Hephzibah.

These marine catches have remained relatively stable since the mid-nineties (between 80 and 86 million tonnes). Most marine fisheries are based near the coast. This is not only because harvesting from relatively shallow waters is easier than in the open ocean, but also because fish are much more abundant near the coastal shelf, due to the abundance of nutrients available there from coastal upwelling and land runoff. However, productive wild fisheries also exist in open oceans, particularly by seamounts, and inland in lakes and rivers.",

In their paper on string theory and noncommutative geometry, Seiberg and Witten studied certain noncommutative quantum field theories that arise as limits of string theory. In another well-known paper, they studied aspects of supersymmetric gauge theory. The latter paper, combined with Witten's earlier work on topological quantum field theory, led to developments in the topology of smooth 4-manifolds, in particular the notion of Seiberg–Witten invariants.",

Lawrence Primary School in his honour) from 1891 until 1898, becoming the first local pupil to win a county council scholarship to Nottingham High School in nearby Nottingham. He left in 1901, working for three months as a junior clerk at Haywood's surgical appliances factory, but a severe bout of pneumonia ended this career. During his convalescence he often visited Hagg's Farm, the home of the Chambers family, and began a friendship with Jessie Chambers, one of the daughters who would go on to inspire characters in his writing. An important aspect of this relationship with Chambers and other adolescent acquaintances was a shared love of books, an interest that lasted throughout Lawrence's life.",

H. Lawrence Primary School\" and the information that Lawrence was \"young\" at the time. \n\nWe only know from the English that Lawrence \"left\" Nottingham High School in 1901, but the Chinese states that he \"graduated\" (毕业) from the school in 1901. \n\nThe Chinese reserves the reference to the three-month duration of Lawrence's job at Haywood's factory to the clause about Lawrence's bout of pneumonia; it also suggests he \"had no choice but to quit his job\" (只好离职). The use of \"只好\" (\"had no choice but to...\") corresponds to the sense conveyed in the English that Lawrence's \"career\" \"ended\" against his wishes, or because of reasons beyond his control (his illness).\n\nAdditional details not given in the English pertaining to Lawrence's life after leaving the factory are provided.

The main cables, which are free to move on bearings in the towers, bear the load of the bridge deck. Before the deck is installed, the cables are under tension from their own weight. Along the main cables smaller cables or rods connect to the bridge deck, which is lifted in sections. As this is done, the tension in the cables increases, as it does with the live load of traffic crossing the bridge. The tension on the main cables is transferred to the ground at the anchorages and by downwards compression on the towers.",

According to certain traditions, these festivals were initiated in Medina after the migration of Muhammad from Mecca. Anas, a well-known companion of the Islamic prophet, narrated that, when Muhammad arrived in Medina, he found people celebrating two specific days in which they entertained themselves with recreation and merriment. At this, Muhammad remarked that God had fixed two days of festivity: Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha.",

The \"two specific days\" of celebration described in the English are referred to in the Chinese as \"two folk festivals [for] worshipping idols\" (崇拜偶像). \n\nThe way these festivals, and the Prophet's reaction to them, are described in the English presents a gravely misleading impression when compared to the Chinese; the English implies that the festivals celebrated in Medina either were the two holidays ordained by God, or were not contradictory to them. The Chinese suggests another case entirely: the festivals, being idolatrous and \"benighted\" (矇昧) in spirit, were contrary to God's wishes. \n",

Members of the Fabian Society have included political leaders from other countries, such as Jawaharlal Nehru, who adopted Fabian principles as part of their own political ideologies. The Fabian Society founded the London School of Economics in 1895.",

While his mind remained sharp and lively, his body was giving up, and for the last half-year of his life, the director was largely confined to bed, listening to music and watching television at home. On September 6, 1998, Kurosawa died of a stroke in Setagaya, Tokyo, at the age of 88. At the time of his death, Kurosawa had two children, his son Hisao Kurosawa who married Hiroko Hayashi and his daughter Kazuko Kurosawa who married Harayuki Kato, along with several grandchildren. One of his grandchildren, the actor Takayuki Kato and grandson by Kazuko, became a supporting actor in two films posthumously developed from screenplays written by Kurosawa which remained unproduced during his own lifetime, Takashi Koizumi's After the Rain (1999) and Kei Kumai's The Sea is Watching (2002).",

A farewell ceremony was held on September 13 of the same year. Approximately 35,000 people, including Kihachi Okamoto, Tsukasa Yoko, Senkichi Taniguchi, Tatsuya Nakadai, Kyoko Kagawa, Chiaki Mi, Hou Hsiao-hsien, etc., attended Yuichi Tanuma's \"Supervisor Akira Kurosawa・お BETTING NO kai Rana\" \"Today's はハッピーエンドです\". Because Akira Kurosawa had no religious beliefs during his lifetime, he was buried in Kamakura City with his late wife (who passed away in 1985) and was given the inscription \"Eimei-in Den Hōkuni, the Great Patriarch of Kindness\"."
