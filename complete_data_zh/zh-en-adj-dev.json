  "text": "Haeckel was a flamboyant figure, who sometimes took great, non-scientific leaps from available evidence. For example, at the time when Darwin published On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection (1859), Haeckel postulated that evidence of human evolution would be found in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). At that time, no remains of human ancestors had yet been identified. He described these theoretical remains in great detail and even named the as-yet unfound species, Pithecanthropus alalus, and instructed his students such as Richard and Oskar Hertwig to go and find it.",

  "text": "Earth sciences can include the study of geology, the lithosphere, and the large-scale structure of Earth's interior, as well as the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. Typically, Earth scientists use tools from geology, chronology, physics, chemistry, geography, biology, and mathematics to build a quantitative understanding of how Earth works and evolves. For example, meteorologists study the weather and watch for dangerous storms. Hydrologists examine water and warn of floods. Seismologists study earthquakes and try to understand where they will strike. Geologists study rocks and help to locate useful minerals. Earth scientists often work in the field—perhaps climbing mountains, exploring the seabed, crawling through caves, or wading in swamps. They measure and collect samples (such as rocks or river water), then record their findings on charts and maps.",

It encompasses the land that people step on, the air that we breathe every minute, the oceans that are closely related to our lives, the stars, the moon, the sun, and even the entire universe that we live with day and night. are all subjects of research. Scientists use various theories to study the Earth. For example, mathematics helps calculate the trajectory of comets, the movement of air masses, and the magnitude of earthquakes; physics is used to study the Earth's gravity field, the gravitational effects between stars, and the movement of fronts or ocean currents; through Chemical knowledge can analyze the chemical composition of rocks; while biological principles can help understand the hidden meanings of fossils and further establish an evolutionary structure."

The animal is regulated in all three of its range countries, and is found in a number of protected areas of the United States, its principal territory. Estimates from the US Fish and Wildlife Service placed bobcat numbers between 700,000 and 1,500,000 in the US in 1988, with increased range and population density suggesting even greater numbers in subsequent years; for these reasons, the U.S. has petitioned CITES to remove the cat from Appendix II. Populations in Canada and Mexico remain stable and healthy. It is listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List, noting it is relatively widespread and abundant, but information from southern Mexico is poor.",

It was estimated in 1988 that the number of bobcats in the United States ranged from 700,000 to 1,500,000, with the number increasing every year. The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists bobcats as not at risk for the time being, which shows that they are relatively widely distributed, but there are no clear statistics in southern Mexico."

Other possible locations include Forbes House in Ham, London, the home of her maternal grandmother, Louisa Scott. Her birth was registered at Hitchin, Hertfordshire, near the Strathmores' English country house, St Paul's Walden Bury, which was also given as her birthplace in the census the following year. She was christened there on 23 September 1900, in the local parish church, All Saints.",

Although reticent about his religious views, in 1879 he wrote that \"I have never been an atheist in the sense of denying the existence of a God. – I think that generally ... an agnostic would be the most correct description of my state of mind.\"",

Changing his name to Akhenaten, he touted the previously obscure sun deity Aten as the supreme deity, suppressed the worship of most other deities, and moved the capital to the new city of Akhetaten (modern-day Amarna). He was devoted to his new religion and artistic style. After his death, the cult of the Aten was quickly abandoned and the traditional religious order restored. The subsequent pharaohs, Tutankhamun, Ay, and Horemheb, worked to erase all mention of Akhenaten's heresy, now known as the Amarna Period.",

He changed his name to Akhenaten (literally \"Servant of Aten\" or \"Glorious Soul of Aten\"), exalted the previously inconspicuous sun god Aten as the highest god, banned the worship of other gods, and attacked monks The power of the group also moved the capital to the new city of Ekhtaton (meaning Aten's sight, today's Amarna). Later pharaohs Tutankhamen, Itnut Ay, and Horamheb quickly erased all records of Amenhotep IV. This short period was called the Amarna era."

The oblong hermaphrodite flowers develop The fruit is the best. Due to the difference in flower sex, plants can be divided into unisexual plants and hermaphrodite plants. Female plants only bloom female flowers, and the flower sex is stable. If pollen from hermaphrodite plants is pollinated, the fruiting will be strong, and there will also be natural parthenocarpy. Hermaphroditic plants bloom various types of flowers, which are often affected by external conditions. The flowers are unstable and produce different fruits, which is called heteromorphic fruiting."

During the evolution of the solar system, the orbits of comets are not dynamically stable, and they will eventually crash into the sun or planets, or be thrown out of the solar system by the perturbations of planets. In addition, due to the highly volatile components, every time a comet approaches the sun, the radiation from the sun will gradually volatilize the comet's material until the comet disintegrates or forms a protective shell."

They are either placed in the insect superfamily Aphidoidea or into the superfamily Phylloxeroidea which contains the family Adelgidae and the family Phylloxeridae. Like aphids, phylloxera feed on the roots, leaves, and shoots of grape plants, but unlike aphids, do not produce honeydew or cornicle secretions. Phylloxera (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae) are insects which caused the Great French Wine Blight that devastated European viticulture in the 19th century. Similarly, adelgids or woolly conifer aphids, also feed on plant phloem and are sometimes described as aphids, but are more properly classified as aphid-like insects, because they have no cauda or cornicles.",

Becoming a clergyman upon his release, he died a month before his son's birth. His widow married a master bricklayer two years later. Jonson attended school in St Martin's Lane in London. Later, a family friend paid for his studies at Westminster School, where the antiquarian, historian, topographer and officer of arms William Camden (1551–1623) was one of his masters. The pupil and master became friends, and the intellectual influence of Camden's broad-ranging scholarship upon Jonson's art and literary style remained notable, until Camden's death in 1623.",

  "text": "The defiant Whig Congress would not raise tariffs in a way that would affect the distribution of funds to states. In June 1842 they passed two bills that would raise tariffs and unconditionally extend the distribution program. Believing it improper to continue distribution at a time when federal revenue shortage necessitated increasing the tariff, Tyler vetoed both bills, burning any remaining bridges between himself and the Whigs. Congress tried again, combining the two into one bill; Tyler vetoed it again, to the dismay of many in Congress, who nevertheless failed to override the veto. As some action was necessary, Whigs in Congress, led by the House Ways and Means chairman Millard Fillmore, passed in each house (by one vote) a bill restoring tariffs to 1832 levels and ending the distribution program. Tyler signed the Tariff of 1842 on August 30, pocket vetoing a separate bill to restore distribution.",

  "translation3": "The Whig Congress, bent on opposing the president, was unwilling to affect the allocation of funds to states to increase tariffs. In June 1842, it passed a bill to increase tariffs and unconditionally extend the time limit of the allocation plan. Taylor believed that it was unwise to continue allocating funds to the states when tariffs must be raised to cope with federal revenue shortfalls. He vetoed two bills, leaving no room for accommodation with the Whigs. Congress merged the two bills and passed them again, but the president still vetoed them. Although members of Congress were dissatisfied, they could not reach the absolute majority required to overturn the veto. The revenue problem had to be alleviated through measures. Whig congressmen, led by Millard Fillmore, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, passed bills in both houses with a one-vote advantage to restore the tariff to the 1832 level and suspend the distribution plan."

In November 2012, HTC and Apple issued a joint statement to end the 32-month patent litigation battle. The two parties reached a settlement and would cancel all global patent litigation disputes and sign a ten-year patent licensing contract, covering both parties' existing and patents held in the future."

It officially withdrew from the mobile phone market on July 31. In July 2021, LG Electronics spun off the electric vehicle transmission system business of its auto parts business division and established \"LG Magna Electric Transmission System Company\" with Magna International.

  "text": "Peas are annual plants, with a life cycle of one year. They are a cool-season crop grown in many parts of the world; planting can take place from winter to early summer depending on location. The average pea weighs between 0.1 and 0.36 gram. The immature peas (and in snow peas the tender pod as well) are used as a vegetable, fresh, frozen or canned; varieties of the species typically called field peas are grown to produce dry peas like the split pea shelled from a matured pod. These are the basis of pease porridge and pea soup, staples of medieval cuisine; in Europe, consuming fresh immature green peas was an innovation of early modern cuisine.",

Before sowing, the seeds need to be soaked in cold water. Applying nitrogen fertilizer is beneficial to the growth of stems and leaves and promotes luxuriant pea seedlings. Watering is especially needed when pods are formed. The yield of bean-eating varieties can reach 3.2 tons of dry beans per hectare, the pod-eating varieties can reach 16 tons of fresh pods per hectare, and the special seedling-eating varieties can be harvested multiple times, with the cumulative yield reaching 12.8 tons of young shoots per hectare."

By the mid-16th century, the electoral process had evolved into its present form, allowing for variation in the time between the death of the pope and the meeting of the cardinal electors.

Microsoft currently extends Office as a development platform, which can be used with third-party software downloaded through a dedicated store."

In any case, the reader will at least get the idea from the Chinese that LinkedIn barred Internet users in Syria from accessing the site; and this idea, when read in the English, will not represent something \"new\" beyond the mention of IP addresses (which itself could be inferred from the use of \"from\" in both paragraphs).",

During a live news conference to promote condom use among truck drivers, he embraced Bollywood superstar Shilpa Shetty, dipped her, and kissed her several times on the cheek. As a result of that gesture, a local court ordered the arrest of Gere and Shetty, finding them in violation of public obscenity laws. Gere has said the controversy was \"manufactured by a small hard-line political party\". About a month later, a two-judge bench headed by the Chief Justice of India, K. G. Balakrishnan, described the case as \"frivolous\" and believed that such complaints against celebrities were filed for \"cheap publicity\" and have brought a bad name to the country. They ruled that Gere would remain free to enter the country.",

It is fair to say that this event was a \"rally,\" as it is described in the English, especially because a rally is not only a live, public event, but one organized to promote awareness of an issue--\"awareness\" is explicit in the apparent name of the event, and the issue is clearly AIDS. \n\nEN: \"live news conference\"; CN: \"live news broadcast.\" \n\nWe cannot come to the conclusion from the Chinese that Shetty is a \"superstar\"; we know that she is a \"star,\" and that she is probably a fairly prominent one, because Richard Gere is a prominent public figure in the West, and this event seems to have received a lot of attention--indeed, it was subject of the focus of the Chief Justice of India. Nonetheless, \"superstar\" is too specific an idea to be inferable given what we are by the Chinese.  \n\nIn reality, as in the English, there is only one Chief Justice of India; \"have\" (in \"have brought a bad name to the country\") is not inferable, first, because the Chinese omits the judges' comments about \"such complaints\" (meaning other complaints), and second, because the Chinese suggests that the judges believed the case \"might give India a bad name\"; there is no sense that the damage is already done. \n\nWe can infer from the Chinese that the judges' decision with respect to Gere's freedom of ingress to India--they overturned the ban that had been placed on his (future) entry into India--would stipulate, by definition, that \"he would remain free to enter the country.\"",

Ludwig von Mises of the Austrian school of economics argued that socialism would inevitably fail economically because the economic calculation problem destined the government to never correctly calculate an extremely complex economic system. As long as there is no price mechanism, the socialist government will not be able to obtain information about market demand due to information asymmetry, and what will follow will inevitably be the failure of the plan and the complete collapse of the economy."

His premiership was followed by Lal Bahadur Shastri's short tenure and Indira Gandhi's 11- and 4-year-long tenures, both politicians belonging to the Indian National Congress. After Indira Gandhi's assassination, her son Rajiv Gandhi took charge until 1989, when a decade with six unstable governments began. This was followed by the full terms of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Manmohan Singh, and Narendra Modi. Modi is the 14th and current prime minister of India, serving since 26 May 2014.",

  "text": "The word robotics was derived from the word robot, which was introduced to the public by Czech writer Karel Čapek in his play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots), which was published in 1920. The word robot comes from the Slavic word robota, which means labour and originally forced labour. The play begins in a factory that makes artificial people called robots, creatures who can be mistaken for humans – very similar to the modern ideas of androids. Karel Čapek himself did not coin the word. He wrote a short letter in reference to an etymology in the Oxford English Dictionary in which he named his brother Josef Čapek as its actual originator.",

    "comment": "It is slightly unclear whether the Chinese captures the idea that the play was published in 1920, or if it is describing the year that Capek \"mentioned\" (提出) the word \"robot.\" \nThe Chinese reflects \"artificial people\" in its use of \"human-made people\" (人造人), but the English elaborates: \"creatures who can be mistaken for humans,\" which is inferable (and, I might add, redundant). \nBecause the Chinese notes that Capek \"mentioned\" the word \"robot\" in his play, when we learn in the English that he \"did not coin the word,\" this strikes us as inferable information--the Chinese is not making a claim to the contrary.",

The resting configuration of the fingers is curved, creating a suspensory hook grip. With the thumb out of the way, the fingers (and hands) can grip securely around objects with a small diameter by resting the tops of the fingers against the inside of the palm, thus creating a double-locked grip. Their feet have four long toes and an opposable big toe, giving them hand-like dexterity. The hip joints also allow for their legs to rotate similarly to their arms and shoulders.",

  "text": "About 80% of identical twins shared the same preference for the herb, but fraternal twins agreed only about half the time, strongly suggesting a genetic component to the preference. In a genetic survey of nearly 30,000 people, two genetic variants linked to the perception of coriander have been found, the most common of which is a gene involved in sensing smells. The gene OR6A2 lies within a cluster of olfactory-receptor genes, and encodes a receptor that is highly sensitive to aldehyde chemicals. Flavour chemists have found that the coriander aroma is created by a half-dozen substances, most of which are aldehydes. Those who dislike the taste are sensitive to the offending unsaturated aldehydes and, at the same time, may be unable to detect the aromatic chemicals that others find pleasant. Association between its taste and several other genes, including a bitter-taste receptor, have also been found.",

In a genetic survey of nearly 30,000 people, two genetic variants related to cilantro perception have been found, the most common of which is a gene involved in perceiving odor. Those who dislike the taste of cilantro are sensitive to unsaturated aldehydes that are easily off-putting, and may also be unable to detect the aroma chemicals that others find pleasant."

(From the English we can guess that it refers to his preeminence in the world of tragic performance, but we cannot come to the same conclusion moving in the other direction). \n\nWe can infer that Corneille's fame came about during his lifetime, and therefore during \"the 17th century.\"\n\nThe segment \"most successful writer of French tragedies\" is difficult. Of course, this claim per se is missing from the Chinese, so strictly speaking, it should be annotated as new information. But the inclusion of \"第一位\" suggests that Corneille is the foremost in some category; and because we know that Racine was \"his rival/competitor\" (竞争者), and that Racine was also playwright (we know the name of one of his works, Bérénice), then we may assume that the category in which Corneille was foremost is that of sixteenth-century French tragic playwrights, etc. But, to be conservative, we can only infer, at the very most, the superlative claim made in the English, which might match up with \"第一位\" (which, it is worth bearing in mind, is not always a superlative; it can refer to the first in an arbitrary sequence, like the first in a line).

  "text": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a type of degenerative joint disease that results from breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone which affects 1 in 7 adults in the United States. It is believed to be the fourth leading cause of disability in the world. The most common symptoms are joint pain and stiffness. Usually the symptoms progress slowly over years. Other symptoms may include joint swelling, decreased range of motion, and, when the back is affected, weakness or numbness of the arms and legs. The most commonly involved joints are the two near the ends of the fingers and the joint at the base of the thumbs, the knee and hip joints, and the joints of the neck and lower back. The symptoms can interfere with work and normal daily activities. Unlike some other types of arthritis, only the joints, not internal organs, are affected.",

  "translation3": "Osteoarthritis (abbreviation: OA), also known as degenerative arthritis, is a type of arthritis caused by damage to bones under the joints. Common symptoms are joint pain or stiffness. The first onset is often only seen after exercise, but the number of episodes will increase over time. Increase; other symptoms include, decrease, and if it affects the back, it may cause weakness or numbness in the limbs. Osteoarthritis often occurs on a specific side and less frequently on the other side; it often lasts for many years and may affect daily life or work. Osteoarthritis is different from other arthritis in that it only invades the joints but does not Attack other organizations."

  "text": "The abdomen consists of ten segments and contains the gut and genital organs. The front eight segments have spiracles and the terminal segment is modified for reproduction. The male has a pair of clasping organs attached to a ring structure, and during copulation, a tubular structure is extruded and inserted into the female's vagina. A spermatophore is deposited in the female, following which the sperm make their way to a seminal receptacle where they are stored for later use. In both sexes, the genitalia are adorned with various spines, teeth, scales and bristles, which act to prevent the butterfly from mating with an insect of another species. After it emerges from its pupal stage, a butterfly cannot fly until the wings are unfolded. A newly emerged butterfly needs to spend some time inflating its wings with hemolymph and letting them dry, during which time it is extremely vulnerable to predators.",

The same goes for the Cook Islands, Hawaii, Cuba, New Caledonia, \"Gibraltar\" (which, being located immediately to the south of Spain, is inferable in the other direction; that is, we can infer from the mention of Gibraltar that the butterfly is found in \"southern Spain,\" as the Chinese claims), and Morocco.

  "text": "MS-DOS was a renamed form of 86-DOS owned by Seattle Computer Products, written by Tim Paterson. Development of 86-DOS took only six weeks, as it was basically a clone of Digital Research's CP/M (for 8080/Z80 processors), ported to run on 8086 processors and with two notable differences compared to CP/M: an improved disk sector buffering logic, and the introduction of FAT12 instead of the CP/M filesystem. This first version was shipped in August 1980. Microsoft, which needed an operating system for the IBM Personal Computer, hired Tim Paterson in May 1981 and bought 86-DOS 1.10 for in July of the same year. Microsoft kept the version number, but renamed it MS-DOS. They also licensed MS-DOS 1.10/1.14 to IBM, which, in August 1981, offered it as PC DOS 1.0 as one of three operating systems for the IBM 5150 or the IBM PC.",

  "text": "Acupuncture is not recommended for the treatment as there is insufficient evidence to support its use. Air ionisers show no evidence that they improve asthma symptoms or benefit lung function; this applied equally to positive and negative ion generators. Manual therapies, including osteopathic, chiropractic, physiotherapeutic and respiratory therapeutic maneuvers, have insufficient evidence to support their use in treating asthma. The Buteyko breathing technique for controlling hyperventilation may result in a reduction in medication use; however, the technique does not have any effect on lung function. Thus an expert panel felt that evidence was insufficient to support its use. There is no clear evidence that breathing exercises are effective for treating children with asthma.",

This set the stage for the eventual unification with the rest of Italy in 1861, when the Kingdom of Naples was brought into the union by Giuseppe Garibaldi. The unification was orchestrated by Great Britain in an attempt to nationalize the production of sulfur from the two volcanoes located in Naples and Sicily respectively. The Aspromonte was the scene of a famous battle of the unification of Italy. During the late 19th or early 20th century, pianist and composer Alfonso Rendano invented the \"Third Pedal\", which augmented the interpretative resources of the piano.",

PayPal spent $25 a share in cash to acquire the publicly traded Xoom, or about $1.09 billion. The deal was closed in the fourth quarter of 2015. The move strengthened PayPal’s international business, giving it access to Xoom’s 1.3 million active U.S. customers that sent about $7 billion in the 12 months ending on March 31, to people in 37 countries.",

    "comment": "The Chinese suggests that the July event was PayPal's acquisition of Xoom; the English states that it was merely PayPal's announcement of its acquisition of Xoom. In any case, the English then notes that \"the deal was closed in the fourth quarter of 2015.\" Q4 comprises October, November and December--so the purchase couldn't have taken place (at least, it could not have been completed) in July.\n\nTechnically, there is nothing in the Chinese to suggest that Xoom is a \"digital\" money transfer company; we just know that it is a \"cross-border money transfer\" service. The latter service predates \"digital\" transfer services, like PayPal; so, not all \"cross-border money transfer\" services are \"digital.\"\n\nThe Chinese observes that PayPal, with its acquisition of Xoom, \"gained a foothold\" (literally, \"set foot in,\" 踏入)...in the cross-border money transfer market.\" The English remarks that \"the move\" (meaning the acquisition) \"strengthened PayPal's international business.\" \n\nTechnically, whether PayPal had a presence in the cross-border (which is roughly synonymous with \"international\") money transfer market before it acquired Xoom, the move to acquire Xoom would presumably give PayPal a better outlook in that market. So, we might regard the sentence fragment beginning with \"The move strengthened\" as inferable, but it's not cut and dry. Also, if one \"sets foot in,\" then one has access; so the remark about \"access\" is also inferable. ",

Controlled-source seismology has been used to map salt domes, anticlines and other geologic traps in petroleum-bearing rocks, faults, rock types, and long-buried giant meteor craters. For example, the Chicxulub Crater, which was caused by an impact that has been implicated in the extinction of the dinosaurs, was localized to Central America by analyzing ejecta in the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary, and then physically proven to exist using seismic maps from oil exploration.",

The first surgery on the heart itself was performed by Axel Cappelen on 4 September 1895 at Rikshospitalet in Kristiania, now Oslo. Cappelen ligated a bleeding coronary artery in a 24-year-old man who had been stabbed in the left axilla and was in deep shock upon arrival. The patient awoke and seemed fine for 24 hours but became ill with a fever and died three days after the surgery from mediastinitis.",

  "title": "Cardiac surgery",
  "translation3": "The earliest known cardiac surgery was a pericardial window performed by Spanish physician Francisco Romero in 1801 on a patient with hydropericardium. On September 7, 1896, Dr. Ludwig Rehn of Frankfurt, Germany, repaired a patient's punctured right ventricle. He fully recovered after the operation, becoming the first successful cardiac surgery. At that time, the risks of heart surgery were extremely high. The famous Austrian doctor Theodor Billroth (1829-1894) once said: “To operate on the heart is a blasphemy to the art of surgery."

However, the requirements to perform this measurement are very exacting, due to the great difference in the mass ratio, and the typically long period of the planet's orbit. Detection of position shifts of a star is a very exacting science, and it is difficult to achieve the necessary precision. Space telescopes can avoid the blurring effect of Earth's atmosphere, resulting in more precise resolution.",

When the investigation team arrived in Germany, it happened to coincide with the Nazi Party coming to power in 1933. Hitler reversed his previous attitude and announced \"full support for the Olympic Games.\" To this end, Hitler ordered the government to allocate 20 million marks (equivalent to 8 million US dollars at the time) to fund the Berlin Olympics and build the Berlin Olympic Stadium in Berlin that could accommodate 100,000 people. The government required artists to display the developed muscles and heroic strength of the Aryan race in sports posters, emphasizing the \"Aryan race superiority theory.\" The Olympics became a stage for Hitler and the Nazis to promote their political ideas."

His prominence grew after the arrival of Islamic rule in the Indian subcontinent. He is viewed as the ideal combination of shakti (\"strength, heroic initiative and assertive excellence\") and bhakti (\"loving, emotional devotion to his personal god Rama\"). Beyond wrestlers, he has been the patron god of other martial arts. He is stated to be a gifted grammarian, meditating yogi and diligent scholar. He exemplifies the human excellences of temperance, faith and service to a cause.",

The ganglia of the sympathetic nervous system are located between the first thoracic vertebrae and the second lumbar vertebrae (T1-L2), closer to the spine and farther away from the organs. The parasympathetic nervous system sends messages through the 3rd, 7th, 9th, and 10th cranial nerves and sacral spinal cord (S2, S3, S4). It has longer preganglionic neurons that are closer to the organs or distributed in the organs. The inner ganglion forms synapses with shorter postganglionic neurons."

His mother and wife were deaf, all of which profoundly affected Bell's life's work. His studies of hearing and speech further led him to invent an experimental hearing device that would eventually lead to Bell being granted the first U.S. patent for the telephone in 1876. Before him, the German Philip Reis had invented a telephone, but its sound transmission was so poor that it was practically unusable."

A barcode is a machine-readable optical label that can contain information about the item to which it is attached. In practice, QR codes often contain data for a locator, identifier, or tracker that points to a website or application. QR codes use four standardized encoding modes (numeric, alphanumeric, byte/binary, and kanji) to store data efficiently; extensions may also be used.",

Winds spill across the Himalayas and flow to the southwest across the country, resulting in clear, sunny skies. Though the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and other sources refers to this period as a fourth (\"post-monsoon\") season, other sources designate only three seasons. Depending on location, this period lasts from October to November, after the southwest monsoon has peaked. Less and less precipitation falls, and vegetation begins to dry out. In most parts of India, this period marks the transition from wet to dry seasonal conditions. Average daily maximum temperatures range between in the Southern parts.",

The climate in southern India is generally hotter and more humid than that in northern India. India's climate is divided into rainy season (June-October), dry season (March-May) and cool season (November-February). In winter, it is affected by the barrier of the Himalayas, and there is no cold current or cold high pressure southward to affect India."

This use of the book's universe was approved by Kipling at the request of Robert Baden-Powell, founder of the Scouting movement, who had originally asked for the author's permission for the use of the Memory Game from Kim in his scheme to develop the morale and fitness of working-class youths in cities. Akela, the head wolf in The Jungle Book, has become a senior figure in the movement; the name is traditionally adopted by the leader of each Cub Scout pack.",

  "text": "Yet for other critics, it has not been so easy to resolve the question of Macbeth's motivation. Robert Bridges, for instance, perceived a paradox: a character able to express such convincing horror before Duncan's murder would likely be incapable of committing the crime. For many critics, Macbeth's motivations in the first act appear vague and insufficient. John Dover Wilson hypothesised that Shakespeare's original text had an extra scene or scenes where husband and wife discussed their plans. This interpretation is not fully provable; however, the motivating role of ambition for Macbeth is universally recognised. The evil actions motivated by his ambition seem to trap him in a cycle of increasing evil, as Macbeth himself recognises: \"I am in bloodStepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more, Returning were as tedious as go o'er.\"",

But we cannot come away from the Chinese with a sense that this motivation is \"universally recognized.\" \n\nA vicious cycle, as the Chinese puts it, would seem to be one of \"increasing\" negative effects; we know that his actions were \"evil,\" so, we can suggest that the \"vicious cycle\" that Macbeth found himself in resulted in \"increasing evil,\" as the English puts it. So, this is inferable. Moreover, we know from the quote that Macbeth \"recognizes\" this to be the case. \n\nOne note about the Chinese quotation from Macbeth: The Chinese reads, literally, \"I already am deeply submerged with both of my feet in a pool of blood,\" while the English says, \"I am in blood Stepp'd in so far.\" There is a difference here that is worth pointing out; I cannot go back and edit my previous annotations, but if I could, I would mark \"both of my feet\" (两足) as \"inferable.\"",

The only parts of the underlined phrase in the English that are not inferable are, \"Security Council\" and \"mid-.\" Moreover, there could not have been a stalemate and a report--in and of the UN--concerning the proposal, had the proposal not been submitted to the UN in the first place. Therefore, this underlined sentence is, in the main, inferable. \n\n\"Mutually\" is easily inferable from the Chinese (\"双方都能接受,\" \"acceptable-to-both-parties/sides\"). ",

At this time, Trinity in the real world clung to Neo, talked to him and kissed him deeply. After feeling the deep love in the real world, Neo was resurrected as if he had an epiphany. After the resurrection, Neo regarded himself as \"the savior\" There is no longer any doubt about his identity, and he understands that he has the ability to rewrite the program in the \"matrix\". Neo's intrusion into Smith's code caused him to be overwritten and deleted. Smith exploded and was annihilated.

In any case, we must go on what we have been given, and thus \"was\" needs to be marked as \"new information.\"\n\nEN: \"Greek goddess\"; CN: \"goddess of Roman mythology\" (Of course, Roman mythology basically is the same as Greek mythology, but that is beside the point....) \n\nThe claim that \"Maia...was identified with the Roman era goddess of fertility, Bona Dea,\" is completely missing from the Chinese. But, elements of this claim are present: We know of Maia, the goddess, that she was of the \"Roman era,\" had to do with fertility, and that the festival in honor of Bona Dea occured in May. But put together, the claim as presented in the English is unrecognizable and thus, novel. But parsing this with annotations is difficult (for example, the Chinese does not indicate that Bona Dea was \"the Roman era goddess of fertility\"; in fact, it suggests that Maia was that goddess, and does not give any such information about Bona Dea. \n\nThe Chinese suggests three etymologies, while the English suggests two; thus \"a second etymology\" is not inferable.

By describing the cases as occurring \"each year\" (每年), we already get the sense that they are \"new\" cases, especially when the time reference (each year, 每年), is combined with the verb for \"to suffer from,\" and since the figure should not reasonably repeat information already given in the paragraph (specially the figure for the total number of people affected by RA), we can assume that these are \"new\" cases.\n\nEN: \"resulted in...deaths\"; CN: \"caused...deaths\" (造成 being the verb; 造成 always means \"cause,\" and always has a negative connotation).\n\nThere is no sense obtainable from the Chinese that the 1800 description was the first \"recognized\" description, however intuitive it may be that were it not \"recognized,\" this description would not have gotten a mention by this entry in the first place. (Moreover, the entry effectively \"recognizes\" the description by citing it).\n\nWe cannot conclude from the Chinese alone that Landré-Beauvais was \"of Paris\"; we only know that the description was produced in Paris.\n\nThe Chinese suggests that the term \"rheumatoid arthritis\" \"derives from\" (源自) or \"originates from\"; \"based on\" is a very similar, although not identical idea.

Moreover, Ozawa is introduced as a \"conductor.\" It is commonly understood that conductors conduct orchestras. \n\n\"Nagano Olympic Stadium\" is arguably inferable: The Chinese states that this occurred during the \"opening ceremony\" of the next Winter Olympics held in Japan after the 1972 Sapporo games--it is generally understood that Olympic Games' opening ceremonies take place in the main venue of the games--a stadium (indeed, an \"Olympic Stadium\"). It is debatable that one could infer \"Nagano\" from the Chinese text, but I am going to label it as such, because the place name could be inferred as the location of the Olympics from what we know--that this was a Japanese locale.

Trees include maple, many oaks and nothofagus, elm, beech, aspen, and birch, among others, as well as a number of coniferous genera, such as larch and Metasequoia. Deciduous shrubs include honeysuckle, viburnum, and many others. Most temperate woody vines are also deciduous, including grapes, poison ivy, Virginia creeper, wisteria, etc. The characteristic is useful in plant identification; for instance in parts of Southern California and the American Southeast, deciduous and evergreen oak species may grow side by side.",

So, while the Chinese does not state explicitly that these participants \"were allowed,\" it alludes to a threshold of eligibility. \n\nWe know that the forum over whose entrants the Advisory Board and the Prize Board had discretion was a competition because of the use in the Chinese of the word \"prize\" (奖), and the inclusion of \"参选,\" which means \"to participate in selection/election.\"",

Although the passage appears to focus on the responses of \"states,\" per se, to secular ideals (that is, the form of government adopted and/or overturned by or within states), the idea that \"societies responded in different ways\" is eminently clear; a revolution such as the Islamic Revolution of Iran necessarily involves \"society\" and constitutes a \"response\" by society. \n\nBecause the sentence about Turkey is absent from the Chinese, there is zero evidence in the Chinese to reflect the claim in the English that \"Some Muslim-majority countries are secular\" (referring, by use of the present tense, to the current moment).

  "text": "In 1948, James Brunot, a resident of Newtown, Connecticut, and one of the few owners of the original Criss-Crosswords game, bought the rights to manufacture the game in exchange for granting Butts a royalty on every unit sold. Although he left most of the game (including the distribution of letters) unchanged, Brunot slightly rearranged the \"premium\" squares of the board and simplified the rules; he also renamed the game Scrabble, a real word which means \"to scratch frantically\". In 1949, Brunot and his family made sets in a converted former schoolhouse in Dodgingtown, Connecticut, a section of Newtown. They made 2,400 sets that year but lost money. According to legend, Scrabbles big break came in 1952 when Jack Straus, president of Macy's, played the game on vacation. Upon returning from vacation, he was surprised to find that his store did not carry the game. He placed a large order, and within a year, \"everyone had to have one\".",

  "text": "Hemingway was devastated on learning that Hadley had lost a suitcase filled with his manuscripts at the Gare de Lyon as she was traveling to Geneva to meet him in December 1922. In the following September the couple returned to Toronto, where their son John Hadley Nicanor was born on October 10, 1923. During their absence, Hemingway's first book, Three Stories and Ten Poems, was published. Two of the stories it contained were all that remained after the loss of the suitcase, and the third had been written early the previous year in Italy. Within months a second volume, in our time (without capitals), was published. The small volume included six vignettes and a dozen stories Hemingway had written the previous summer during his first visit to Spain, where he discovered the thrill of the corrida. He missed Paris, considered Toronto boring, and wanted to return to the life of a writer, rather than live the life of a journalist.",

At that time, Hemingway's first son was born, named John, and asked Gertrude Stein to be John's godmother. As Hemingway had to support the entire family's expenses, Hemingway gradually became busy and began to find his work at the Toronto Star boring, so he resigned on January 1, 1924. Most of Hemingway's works for the Star were later published in Dateline: Toronto in 1985."

Therefore, the use of \"in\" in the English is somewhat misleading. \n\nCN: the program aired \"every Sunday\" night; EN: \"airing Sunday nights\" \nWe come away from both phrasings with more or less the same understanding. A program would probably not be said to air \"Sunday nights\" if it did so on only a biweekly basis, but it would still be the case for a biweekly program that it aired on Sunday nights. ",
