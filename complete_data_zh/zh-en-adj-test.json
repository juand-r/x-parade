    "comment": "\"CP\" (an abbreviation whose meaning I am still unsure of) is not readily apprehended by the reader, despite the condition's complete name being included in the Chinese (the first four characters of the Chinese passage).\n\nThe Chinese makes it clearer than the English does, that immunization of \"the mother\" is only useful as a means of preventing CP (or its \"causes\") when the person whose protection from CP is sought is the baby she is carrying. In other words, there is no utility (in terms of preventing CP in the child) in immunizing his or her mother after the child has already been born. The Chinese does not use the term \"mother,\" but \"the pregnant woman\" (孕婦), all of whom are presumably at least \"expectant\" mothers. \n\nWe can infer, using common sense, that \"improved safety\" would probably lessen the risk of \"head injuries,\" and is therefore probably a good means of preventing head injuries. \n\nCN: \"some affected children can have near normal adult lives\" (where \"have\" is 擁有); EN: \"some affected children can achieve near normal adult lives\" -- There is nothing \"new\" here; \"have\" is understood to mean approximately the same thing as \"achieve\" in this context, because obviously \"children\" do not already have \"adult lives,\" as they are not yet adults, because they are children. \n\nThe English sets up a contradiction in the last sentence, beginning immediately with \"While\"; the Chinese does not begin the sentence with this \"contradiction\" marker. \n\nI would argue that \"there is no evidence to support their use\" is not the same as \"no evidence to support their usefulness.\" The former runs the risk of sounding extreme--as though the \"use\" of these alternative medicines must be regarded with great care, as their introduction to the patient's treatment in the first place is dangerous. On the other hand, \"usefulness\" implies that the therapies may be benign, and merely have no effect, as opposed to having a potentially adverse effect.",

Radar technology has already appeared with ground-to-air, air-to-ground (search) bombing, air-to-air (interception) fire control, and identification of friend or foe. After World War II, radar developed single pulse angle tracking, pulse Doppler signal processing, high resolution of synthetic aperture and pulse compression, combined system combined with identification of friend or foe, automatic fire control system combined with computer, terrain avoidance and terrain following, Passive or active phased array, frequency agility, multi-target detection and tracking and other new radar systems."

It was composed by Joong-sam Yun and appears as music in the music library of most Samsung phones released since 2011. Prior to 2011, \"Beyond Samsung\" served as Samsung's trademark music track, while \"Samsung Tune\" was used as the default ringtone. The sound appears as the default ringtone, as well as the sound when the phone turns on or off (a snippet is used), and as a notification sound. While the basic composition of the six-note tune has not changed since its inception, various versions of different genres have been introduced as the product line evolved.",

We also don't know if subsequent themes, such as the theme introduced in 2021, constitute variations of the 2011 composition, but the Chinese does note, rather vaguely, that the 2011 composition \"still remains,\" or, has not been discarded by Samsung.",

It replaced the earlier used ringtones, which were first used on the Samsung Galaxy S II launched in 2011. It includes device power on and off, default notification ringtones and The default incoming call ringtone is used. The ascending and descending scale composed of the six tones \"Do Do Sol Do↑ Si Sol\" is used as the main axis of the melody. The original version was conceived by Samsung employee Josh Joongsam Yun. Although the incoming call ringtone is a shortened version And remixed, but the corresponding full version can be found in the device folder; even though Samsung launched a new brand theme ringtone in 2021, it is still retained."

Icy Europa's mysterious double ridges may hint at hidden pockets of water . If confirmed, the lakes and pockets of water could be yet another potential habitat for life. Evidence suggests that hydrogen peroxide is abundant across much of the surface of Europa. Because hydrogen peroxide decays into oxygen and water when combined with liquid water, the authors argue that it could be an important energy supply for simple life forms.",

  "text": "Cutaneous anthrax, also known as hide-porter's disease, is when anthrax occurs on the skin. It is the most common form (>90% of anthrax cases). It is the least dangerous form (low mortality with treatment, 23.7% mortality without). Cutaneous anthrax presents as a boil-like skin lesion that eventually forms an ulcer with a black center (eschar). The black eschar often shows up as a large, painless, necrotic ulcer (beginning as an irritating and itchy skin lesion or blister that is dark and usually concentrated as a black dot, somewhat resembling bread mold) at the site of infection. In general, cutaneous infections form within the site of spore penetration between two and five days after exposure. Unlike bruises or most other lesions, cutaneous anthrax infections normally do not cause pain. Nearby lymph nodes may become infected, reddened, swollen, and painful. A scab forms over the lesion soon, and falls off in a few weeks.",

  "translation3": "Cutaneous anthrax infection develops within 1 to 2 weeks. It initially appears as nuisance, itchy skin lesions or black dot-like blisters, similar to the black mold that appears on bread after being left out for a long time, and then develops into large, painless, necrotic ulcers. Cutaneous anthrax does not cause any pain compared to ordinary bruises or most other skin injuries. If left untreated, it has a 20% fatality rate. Although it is lower than other forms of anthrax, it is still very high in medical statistics. , but there is almost no danger after treatment."

Writing to spiritualist journal Light that year, he declared himself to be a spiritualist, describing one particular event that had convinced him psychic phenomena were real. Also in 1887 (on 26 January), he was initiated as a Freemason at the Phoenix Lodge No. 257 in Southsea. (He resigned from the Lodge in 1889, returned to it in 1902, and resigned again in 1911.)",

Wheeler invoked this concept to explain the identical properties shared by all electrons, suggesting that \"they are all the same electron\" with a complex, self-intersecting worldline. Yoichiro Nambu later applied it to all production and annihilation of particle-antiparticle pairs, stating that \"the eventual creation and annihilation of pairs that may occur now and then is no creation or annihilation, but only a change of direction of moving particles, from the past to the future, or from the future to the past.\"",

  "text": "Deadpool was released in the United States on February 12, 2016, after an unconventional marketing campaign. The film achieved both financial and critical success. It earned over $782 million against a $58 million budget, becoming the ninth-highest grossing film of 2016 and breaking numerous records, including the highest-grossing R-rated film at the time. Critics praised Reynolds' performance, the film's style and faithfulness to the comics, along with its action sequences, though some criticized the plot as formulaic and were divided on the film's adult humor. It received many awards and nominations, including two Critics' Choice awards and two Golden Globe nominations.",

Praised - infered from all the things that \"indeed deserve to be praised\". Style and faithfulness to the comics - infered from humor. some criticized - infered from the critics think.

Some lithotrophs can even use the energy contained in sulfur compounds to produce sugars, a process known as chemosynthesis. Some bacteria and archaea use hydrogen sulfide in place of water as the electron donor in chemosynthesis, a process similar to photosynthesis that produces sugars and uses oxygen as the electron acceptor.

  "text": "In early childhood, mild ID (IQ 50–69) may not be obvious or identified until children begin school. Even when poor academic performance is recognized, it may take expert assessment to distinguish mild intellectual disability from specific learning disability or emotional/behavioral disorders. People with mild ID are capable of learning reading and mathematics skills to approximately the level of a typical child aged nine to twelve. They can learn self-care and practical skills, such as cooking or using the local mass transit system. As individuals with intellectual disability reach adulthood, many learn to live independently and maintain gainful employment. About 85% of persons with ID are likely to have mild ID.",

    "comment": "The IQ ranges given in the two paragraphs are different (60-70 in the Chinese and 50-69 in the English). \n\nIf, as the Chinese states, mild ID \"may only present mild signs\" in early childhood and \"is very easy to overlook\" or not detect, and \"may not be diagnosed,\" then we can infer from the Chinese that the condition \"may not be obvious or identified.\" Something that is not obvious could be overlooked; and something that has not been identified cannot be diagnosed. \n\nWhile it is probably to be assumed that the \"further determination\" suggested by the Chinese would be done by an \"expert,\" the appearance of \"expert\" in English constitutes new information that is not immediately apparent or inferable from the Chinese. \n\nEN: \"to distinguish...from\"; CN: \"to confirm whether it is ID, or perhaps a learning disability...\" In either case, we can clearly tell that the further assessment is intended to \"distinguish\" mild ID \"from\" another issue, as the English puts it. \n\nI am unsure whether \"specific learning disability\" is a technical term, or whether there is a word or words missing here. In either case, the Chinese simply says \"a learning disability\" (學習障礙). There is no mention of \"emotional\" disorders, nor is there an explicit mention of a \"disorder.\" The term used here is \"problem\" or \"issue\" (問題), and elsewhere in the Chinese passage \"intellectual disability\" is referred to as \"intellectual impairment\" (智能障礙). \n\nThe matter of whether the suggestion in the English that adults with mild ID \"can learn self-care and practical skills, such as cooking or using the local mass transit system\" constitutes inferable information is tricky. It is true that, as both paragraphs suggest, some adults with mild ID can live independently. One would assume that independent living might entail being able to cook for oneself and perform other \"practical\" tasks. However, to call this information inferable seems a bit tenuous. I will label it as such, but it is arguably totally new information that one could not simply draw from the Chinese. ",

Even if it is found that the child's academic performance is abnormally poor, further judgment must be made to confirm whether it is an intellectual disability, or it may be a learning disability or a simple behavioral problem. When they grow up, many people with mild intellectual disabilities are able to live independently. They may be considered \"slower\" in the eyes of others and not considered \"intelligently disabled\"."

    "comment": "We can reasonably infer from the Chinese that the so-called \"contemporary new religions\" (当代新宗教) described there might \"[incorporate] contemporary\" elements, but we cannot know from the Chinese alone that these elements include \"liberal values.\" Because the Chinese is emphasizing the \"newness\" (新) and contemporaneity (当代) of these religions, it is safe to assume that these religions break in some way from the practices from which they derive (this latter point, about the derivation of these new religions, is mentioned too in the Chinese, \"由这类宗教派生的现当代新宗教,\" meaning, literally, \"the modern and contemporary new religions arising out of this sort of religion,\" or \"...this sort of religious sect/movement.\" \n\nBecause the linkage between the \"new\" religions and their predecessors is made explicit (and is implicit in the use of \"new\") in the Chinese, the use of \"revival\" in the English is arguably inferable. However, that this revival is a \"pagan revival,\" as the English notes, is not clear from the Chinese. All we know from the Chinese is that these religions are \"non-major religions,\" that often feature \"witches/sorcerers,\" \"multiple gods,\" \"shamans,\" \"folk deities\"; and concern indigenous or vernacular \"European\" folk practices. \n\nThe above description obviously accords with what we know of as \"paganism.\" But would we be able to read the Chinese, and then, upon encountering \"pagan\" in the English, be able to make the connection? Perhaps we would, but perhaps we would not. So, I am going to mark this as \"new information\" that is not inferable; the connection is just too vague. \n\nIf we know from the Chinese that we are talking about, among other things, \"Celtic...non-Abrahamic folk-originating religions,\" then we might infer that \"Neo-Druidism\" belongs to that group. \n\n\"Native Faith\" is inferable; we know from the Chinese that indigenous folk religions of Slavic peoples are included in the definition.

  "text": "Greenwich is notable for its maritime history and for giving its name to the Greenwich Meridian (0° longitude) and Greenwich Mean Time. The town became the site of a royal palace, the Palace of Placentia from the 15th century, and was the birthplace of many Tudors, including Henry VIII and Elizabeth I. The palace fell into disrepair during the English Civil War and was demolished to be replaced by the Royal Naval Hospital for Sailors, designed by Sir Christopher Wren and his assistant Nicholas Hawksmoor. These buildings became the Royal Naval College in 1873, and they remained a military education establishment until 1998 when they passed into the hands of the Greenwich Foundation. The historic rooms within these buildings remain open to the public; other buildings are used by University of Greenwich and Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance.",

According to 2015 estimates, only about 60 remain, in Java, Indonesia, all in the wild. It is also the least known rhino species. Like the closely related, and larger, Indian rhinoceros, the Javan rhino has a single horn. Its hairless, hazy gray skin falls into folds into the shoulder, back, and rump, giving it an armored appearance. Its length reaches including the head, and its height . Adults are variously reported to weigh 900–1,400 kgSpecies extinct: Javan Rhinoceros or 1,360–2,000 kg. Male horns can reach 26 cm in length, while in females they are knobs or altogether absent. These animals prefer dense lowland rain forest, tall grass and reed beds that are plentiful with large floodplains and mud wallows.",

    "comment": "Scientific name for the rhinoceros is given. \n\nThe claims in the Chinese that there are only \"sixty pairs\" remaining, and that Vietnam had only one individual as recently as 2010, substantiates the statement in the English that the rhino is \"one of the most endangered large mammals in the world\" \n\nI have noted the apparent discrepancy in the number of extant individuals (either 60 or 60 pairs, according to the English and Chinese, respectively). \n\nI suppose the description of the habitat preferences of the rhinos could be inferable, if one knows something about the climate, topography and ecology of Java and Vietnam; but the description is too specific for me to feel confident that this part could be inferred from the Chinese alone.\n\nIt is arguable that the claim that the remaining rhinos exist \"all in the wild\" (in the English) can be inferred from the Chinese (in which they are said to live in a national park in Java, as opposed to, say, zoos or research facilities, which would fall into the category of \"captivity\"). Given that wild animals are usually described as living \"in the wild\" or \"in captivity\" (in a binary system), the national park setting clearly cannot be described as \"captivity,\" at least based on what we know from the Chinese. \n\nWe know that the Javan rhino has at least one horn from the Chinese, but because plurals are not as evident in Chinese (the word \"角,\" meaning horn, can be plural or singular, depending on the context), it is hard to say definitively if the claim in the English (that the rhino has a single horn) is inferable. \n\nThe description of the rhino's skin is probably guessable by the average person, because rhinos are commonly understood to have gray skin, a tough, armor-like hide, and little hair--but this bit of description definitely constitutes \"new\" information in the context of the two paragraphs.\n\n\"Adults\" is inferable because common sense says that one would not measure an infant or juvenile specimen to ascertain the size of the fully grown animal.",

Aloe flowers are tubular, frequently yellow, orange, pink, or red, and are borne, densely clustered and pendant, at the apex of simple or branched, leafless stems. Many species of Aloe appear to be stemless, with the rosette growing directly at ground level; other varieties may have a branched or unbranched stem from which the fleshy leaves spring. They vary in color from grey to bright-green and are sometimes striped or mottled. Some aloes native to South Africa are tree-like (arborescent).",

  "text": "The two organ systems that help regulate the body's acid–base balance are the kidneys and lungs. Acid–base homeostasis is the maintenance of pH around a value of 7.4. The lungs are part of respiratory system which helps to maintain acid–base homeostasis by regulating carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in the blood. The respiratory system is the first line of defense when the body experiences and acid–base problem. It attempts to return the body pH to a value of 7.4 by controlling the respiratory rate. When the body is experiencing acidic conditions, it will increase the respiratory rate which in turn drives off CO2 and decreases the H+ concentration, therefore increasing the pH. In basic conditions, the respiratory rate will slow down so that the body holds onto more CO2 and increases the H+ concentration and decreases the pH.",

This is mainly achieved by various buffer systems in the body and the regulation of the lungs and kidneys. The kidneys regulate the acid-base balance in the human body by excreting acidic substances and absorbing alkaline substances. They can also maintain acid-base balance by controlling the ratio of the excretion of acidic and alkaline substances."

It was believed that the cranial skull—like a glove on the hand—accommodates to the different sizes of these areas of the brain, so that a person's capacity for a given personality trait could be determined simply by measuring the area of the skull that overlies the corresponding area of the brain.",

I suppose it could be inferred from the range in length provided by the Chinese that the intestines of taller people are generally longer than those of shorter people--but this just seems to be intuitive information. It is possible that \"how the length is measured\" in the English could be paired with the discussion in the Chinese passage about the variation in intestines length that is caused by muscle tightening/contraction--that is, whether one measures intestines while they are contracted or when the muscles are relaxed can produce different results. Nonetheless, this seems like a pretty tenuous association.",

  "text": "Kerry's paternal grandparents, shoe businessman Frederick A. \"Fred\" Kerry and musician Ida Löwe, were immigrants from the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Fred, his wife, and his brother converted from Judaism to Catholicism in 1901, and changed their names from Kohn to Kerry. Ida was of remote ancestry of Rabbi Sinai Loew of Worms, brother of Judah Loew ben Bezalel. Fred and Ida Kerry emigrated to the United States in 1905, living at first in Chicago and eventually moving to Brookline, Massachusetts, by 1915. According to The New York Times, \"[the] brother and sister of John Kerry's paternal grandmother, Otto and Jenni Lowe, died in concentration camps\". Kerry's Jewish ancestry was publicly revealed during his 2004 presidential campaign; he has stated that he was unaware of it until a reporter informed him of it in 2003.",

    "comment": "The Chinese tells us that Fred and Ida were, respectively, born in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and Hungary; but because Hungary was not an independent state around the turn of the century, it is safe to say we can infer that both originated in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Furthermore, we know that at least Fred changed his surname to the English-language surname Kerry, and that John Kerry was born in America (he was eligible to be drafted into the Vietnam War and to run for president). Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that they had immigrated (to the United States). \n\nIda's \"remote ancestry\" is conveyed in the Chinese in the sense that her relation to Rabbi Judah Loew is distant enough to be \"speculated\" about by a historian (as the Chinese says), and because the Rabbi is said in the Chinese to have lived in the sixteenth century (which was about four to three hundred years before the birth of Ida), which means that he was necessarily a remote relation to Idea.\n\nIf Ida was, as the Chinese says, believed to be related to Rabbi Judah Loew, then she would naturally be a relation, too, of his brother (unless his brother was not biologically related to him, but this is not indicated, so we just use common sense).

  "text": "There is no evidence to support the popular claim that he was taught by Jesuits. In 1583, at the age of 11, he began studies at Hart Hall, now Hertford College, Oxford. After three years of studies there, Donne was admitted to the University of Cambridge, where he studied for another three years. Donne could not obtain a degree from either institution because of his Catholicism, since he refused to take the Oath of Supremacy required to graduate. In 1591 he was accepted as a student at the Thavies Inn legal school, one of the Inns of Chancery in London. On 6 May 1592, he was admitted to Lincoln's Inn, one of the Inns of Court.",

Her younger brother Henry was also imprisoned and killed for religious reasons. He studied theology, medicine, law and classics at Hart Hall (now Hertford College, Oxford University) and Cambridge University, but did not obtain a degree in either. Later, he was appreciated by James I for writing articles attacking Catholicism and safeguarding the royal power. He became a royal priest in 1615 and the dean of St. Paul's Cathedral in 1621. He was the most famous missionary at that time until his death in 1631."

Moreover, it makes little sense to do a great deal of work to wood only to then dunk it in a river for weeks or months on end. \n\nThe long and arduous trip the wood took, the exotic location (far from the capital) from which it was harvested, and the origin of the wood in deep, ancient groves all serve to suggest that the wood was \"precious.\" ",

The mission was envisioned to start in 2016, was to last for three years. The company planned to use a \"mothership\", which would be propelled by an ion engine, releasing a lander to the surface of Phobos. The lander would perform some tests and experiments, gather samples in a capsule, then return to the mothership and head back to Earth where the samples would be jettisoned for recovery on the surface.

Likewise for the reference to the leaves on the flowering stem being \"relatively narrow.\" \n\nHowever, the idea that leaves \"[narrow] to just broad\" is different from the idea that leaves become \"relatively narrow\"; in isolation, the latter does not provide any information about the absolute width of the leaves, and only makes a comparison to broader leaves. On the other hand, the Chinese provides measurements of the dimensions of leaves and the plant itself; although one might calculate the ratio of leaf width to stem height and conclude that the leaves are \"broad\" given the height of the plant, I don't think this is solid enough to count as inferable information; \"broad\" seems too subjective. Because this is a bit tricky, being neither totally \"new\" information nor perfectly inferable, I have labelled \"narrowing\" as inferable (it implies a comparison), and \"just broad\" as \"new.\"",

In 1905, Einstein's cautious expression of the mass–energy relationship allowed for the possibility that \"dormant\" mass might exist that would remain behind after all the energy of a body was removed. By 1907, however, Einstein was ready to assert that all inertial mass represented a reserve of energy. \"To equate all mass with energy required an act of aesthetic faith, very characteristic of Einstein.\" Einstein's bold hypothesis has been amply confirmed in the years subsequent to his original proposal.",

If the experimental fact that \"the speed of light in vacuum is independent of the reference system\" is accepted as the basic principle, a new space-time theory (relativistic space-time theory) can be established. In 1905, Einstein published a paper \"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\", establishing the special theory of relativity and successfully describing the motion of macroscopic objects in the sub-light speed field."

Michio Suzuki was intent on making better, more user-friendly looms and, for 30 years his focus was on the development of these machines. Michio's desire to diversify into automotive products was interrupted by World War II. Before it began building four-stroke engines, Suzuki Motor Corp. was known for its two-stroke engines (for motorcycles and autos). After the war, Suzuki made a two-stroke motorized bicycle, but eventually the company would be known for Hayabusa and GSX-R motorcycles, for the QuadRunner, and for dominating racetracks around the world. Even after producing its first car in 1955 the company didn't have an automobile division until 1961. Today Suzuki is among the world's largest automakers, and a major brand name in important markets, including Japan and India, but no longer sells cars in North America.",

  "text": "Though there have been several definitions of \"voluntary\" and \"involuntary unemployment\" in the economics literature, a simple distinction is often applied. Voluntary unemployment is attributed to the individual's decisions, but involuntary unemployment exists because of the socio-economic environment (including the market structure, government intervention, and the level of aggregate demand) in which individuals operate. In these terms, much or most of frictional unemployment is voluntary since it reflects individual search behavior. Voluntary unemployment includes workers who reject low-wage jobs, but involuntary unemployment includes workers fired because of an economic crisis, industrial decline, company bankruptcy, or organizational restructuring.",

This kind of unemployment is classified as involuntary unemployment, because people are able and willing to work, but the total demand of society is reduced to labor. How to solve cyclical unemployment has always been a key research object of economists. The economics community has proposed several methods. Methods, for example: workers or trade unions voluntarily reduce wages; increase investment inducement in the corporate sector to increase aggregate demand; the government uses fiscal policy to supplement the lack of private investment and fill the gap with aggregate demand, etc."

Najm was brought up in a Muslim household, but he has expressed his lack of interest in the concept of religion.

Deception requires subterfuge, which probably requires some cleverness. Nevertheless, the distinct use of \"clever\" in the English passage strikes me as being too starkly \"new,\" compared to the Chinese, for me to treat it as inferable (although it arguably is, as I have just explained).",

  "text": "The breeding season for sloth bears varies according to location: in India, they mate in April, May, and June, and give birth in December and early January, while in Sri Lanka, it occurs all year. Sows gestate for 210 days, and typically give birth in caves or in shelters under boulders. Litters usually consist of one or two cubs, or rarely three. Cubs are born blind, and open their eyes after four weeks. Sloth bear cubs develop quickly compared to most other bear species: they start walking a month after birth, become independent at 24–36 months, and become sexually mature at the age of three years. Young cubs ride on their mother's back when she walks, runs, or climbs trees until they reach a third of her size. Individual riding positions are maintained by cubs through fighting. Intervals between litters can last two to three years.",

Sloth bear babies are usually born in caves or under boulders, where they spend the first three months of their lives before living with their mothers for another two years. Sloth bears move faster than other bears. When walking, running or crawling, sloth bear babies will ride on their mother's back. In order to catch their mother, they will compete for space or even fight with each other."

Sexually dimorphic, females are hornless and smaller than males. Males grow slender, lyre-shaped horns long. The horns, strongly ridged and divergent, are circular in section and hollow at the base. Their arch-like structure allows interlocking of horns, which helps a male throw off his opponent during fights; horns also protect the skull from damage.",

Kant believes that true moral behavior is behavior based purely on obligation, and doing things to achieve a certain personal utilitarian purpose cannot be considered a moral behavior. Therefore, Kant believed that whether an action is moral or not depends not on the consequences of the action, but on the motivation for taking the action. Kant also believes that we are free only when we abide by moral laws, because we abide by the moral rules we have formulated ourselves, and if we do it just because we want to do it, there is no freedom at all, because you become A slave to all things."

He returned to Nantucket in 1820 with more than 2,000 barrels of sperm whale oil and the news of his discovery. This led to an influx of whaleships to exploit the new whaling ground and the Galápagos Islands became a frequent stop for the whalers both before and after visiting what came to be known as the Offshore Grounds.

In 1820, he returned to Nantucket, the center of the world's whaling industry, with more than 2,000 barrels of sperm whale oil and new discoveries. This new discovery caused a large number of whaling ships to flock to the new whaling grounds code-named \"Offshore Grounds\". The Galapagos Islands became a hotspot for whaling ships on their voyages back and forth, and the islands even had a sort of informal post office where the whaling fleets could send and receive letters, as well as supply and repair their ships."

By 1909, Lowell and William H. Pickering had suggested several possible celestial coordinates for such a planet. Lowell and his observatory conducted his search until his death in 1916, but to no avail. Unknown to Lowell, his surveys had captured two faint images of Pluto on March 19 and April 7, 1915, but they were not recognized for what they were.

  "translation3": "The defeat of the Qing army in the Sino-Japanese War (the destruction of the Beiyang Navy) marked a sharp decline in its international status, and it once again became the target of encroachment by the great powers. At the same time, the Sino-Japanese War also marked the failure of the Westernization Movement. After this battle, China's international status plummeted, while Japan became one of the great powers. The terms of the Treaty of Shimonoseki exploited China and inspired Chinese intellectuals to reflect on the national conditions. The reform parties within the Qing government had a deeper understanding of their own weaknesses, which promoted the subsequent reform of the political system, namely the 1898 Reform Movement of 1898, the forerunner of the Hundred Days Reform."

Generally, hyenas are known to drive off larger predators, like lions, from their kills, despite having a reputation in popular culture for being cowardly. Hyenas are primarily nocturnal animals, but sometimes venture from their lairs in the early-morning hours. With the exception of the highly social spotted hyena, hyenas are generally not gregarious animals, though they may live in family groups and congregate at kills.",

Although hyenas are often thought of as timid, they are actually known for driving large predators, such as lions, away from their prey. Spotted hyenas live in groups and hunt in a matrilineal social system, but apart from that, most hyenas are not social animals, although they may also live in groups or gather for hunting, and their natural enemies are lions."

He hoped to keep Russia in the war by convincing the Bolsheviks that they would receive a better peace from the Allies, to bolster Allied morale, and to undermine German war support. The address was well received in the United States and Allied nations and even by Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin, as a landmark of enlightenment in international relations. Wilson subsequently used the Fourteen Points as the basis for negotiating the Treaty of Versailles, which ended the war.",

They married in December 2003 in a ceremony at a hotel in Southern California. She was pregnant with their child at the time of their wedding. Paltrow and Martin have two children together: a daughter, Apple, born in 2004, and a son, Moses, born in 2006. Their son's name was inspired by a song Chris Martin wrote for Paltrow. Simon Pegg and Martin's bandmate Jonny Buckland are her daughter's godfathers.",

Menuhin did have one lesson with Ysaÿe, but he disliked Ysaÿe's teaching method and his advanced age. Instead, he went to Romanian composer and violinist George Enescu, under whose tutelage he made recordings with several piano accompanists, including his sister Hephzibah. He was also a student of Adolf Busch in Basel. He stayed in the Swiss city for a bit more than a year, where he started to take lessons in German and Italian as well.",

These marine catches have remained relatively stable since the mid-nineties (between 80 and 86 million tonnes). Most marine fisheries are based near the coast. This is not only because harvesting from relatively shallow waters is easier than in the open ocean, but also because fish are much more abundant near the coastal shelf, due to the abundance of nutrients available there from coastal upwelling and land runoff. However, productive wild fisheries also exist in open oceans, particularly by seamounts, and inland in lakes and rivers.",

  "text": "In collaboration with Nathan Seiberg, Witten established several powerful results in quantum field theories. In their paper on string theory and noncommutative geometry, Seiberg and Witten studied certain noncommutative quantum field theories that arise as limits of string theory. In another well-known paper, they studied aspects of supersymmetric gauge theory. The latter paper, combined with Witten's earlier work on topological quantum field theory, led to developments in the topology of smooth 4-manifolds, in particular the notion of Seiberg–Witten invariants.",

On May 14, 2011, the band announced a tour of Latin America in the fall of 2011. In June, Joe Perry announced that the band is going to meet at the recording studio to produce the next album of the band in July. On August 30, it was announced that the new album will be released around May 2012. The album will be produced by Jack Douglas, who produced four albums for the band in the 1970s. Aerosmith began their fall tour of Latin America and Japan on October 22 in Lima, Peru. As part of the tour, the band performed in Paraguay, Panama, and Ecuador for the first time in their careers. Their show in Asunción, Paraguay was postponed a day, after lead singer Steven Tyler sustained facial injuries after falling in his hotel room shower, due to a bout of food poisoning that dehydrated him and caused him to faint.",

During his convalescence he often visited Hagg's Farm, the home of the Chambers family, and began a friendship with Jessie Chambers, one of the daughters who would go on to inspire characters in his writing.

After graduating in 1901, Lawrence worked as a junior clerk in a surgical instrument factory in Haywood. Three months later, he contracted severe pneumonia and had to leave. He first returned to his hometown to teach miners' children, and later returned to school and obtained a teaching qualification certificate from the University of Nottingham in 1908."

  "text": "In suspension bridges, large main cables (normally two) hang between the towers and are anchored at each end to the ground. The main cables, which are free to move on bearings in the towers, bear the load of the bridge deck. Before the deck is installed, the cables are under tension from their own weight. Along the main cables smaller cables or rods connect to the bridge deck, which is lifted in sections. As this is done, the tension in the cables increases, as it does with the live load of traffic crossing the bridge. The tension on the main cables is transferred to the ground at the anchorages and by downwards compression on the towers.",

However, their important contribution was through various activities, including academic research publications, lectures, symposia, and the organization of summer schools. The public carries out education and dissemination of socialist ideas and advocates reform measures, thus exerting a great influence on teachers, civil servants, trade union leaders, members of Congress, etc. Since 1889, Fabian Essays in Socialism has been published one after another."

While his mind remained sharp and lively, his body was giving up, and for the last half-year of his life, the director was largely confined to bed, listening to music and watching television at home. On September 6, 1998, Kurosawa died of a stroke in Setagaya, Tokyo, at the age of 88. At the time of his death, Kurosawa had two children, his son Hisao Kurosawa who married Hiroko Hayashi and his daughter Kazuko Kurosawa who married Harayuki Kato, along with several grandchildren. One of his grandchildren, the actor Takayuki Kato and grandson by Kazuko, became a supporting actor in two films posthumously developed from screenplays written by Kurosawa which remained unproduced during his own lifetime, Takashi Koizumi's After the Rain (1999) and Kei Kumai's The Sea is Watching (2002).",

  "translation3": "At 0:45 pm on September 6, 1998, Akira Kurosawa died of a stroke at his home in Naijo, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo. He was 88 years old. A farewell ceremony was held on September 13 of the same year. Approximately 35,000 people, including Kihachi Okamoto, Tsukasa Yoko, Senkichi Taniguchi, Tatsuya Nakadai, Kyoko Kagawa, Chiaki Mi, Hou Hsiao-hsien, etc., attended Yuichi Tanuma's \"Supervisor Akira Kurosawa・お BETTING NO kai Rana\" \"Today's はハッピーエンドです\". Because Akira Kurosawa had no religious beliefs during his lifetime, he was buried in Kamakura City with his late wife (who passed away in 1985) and was given the inscription \"Eimei-in Den Hōkuni, the Great Patriarch of Kindness\"."

The city is home to approximately 30 percent of Pakistan's manufacturing sector, and produces approximately 42 percent of Pakistan's value added in large scale manufacturing. At least 4500 industrial units form Karachi's formal industrial economy. Karachi's informal manufacturing sector employs far more people than the formal sector, though proxy data suggest that the capital employed and value-added from such informal enterprises is far smaller than that of formal sector enterprises. An estimated 63% of the Karachi's workforce is employed in trade and manufacturing.",

  "translation3": "Specific phobia affects about 6 to 8% of the population in Western countries every year, and about 2 to 4% of the population in Asia, Africa, and Latin America suffer from specific phobia every year. Social phobia affects about 7% of the population in the United States and other parts of the world. 0.5~2.5%, agoraphobia affects about 1.7% of people. Female patients are about twice as common as males, and the typical age of onset is about 10 to 17 years old. As age increases, the proportion of patients decreases, and patients with phobia have a higher risk of suicide."

  "text": "A professor is an accomplished and recognized academic. In most Commonwealth nations, as well as northern Europe, the title professor is the highest academic rank at a university. In the United States and Canada, the title of professor applies to most post-doctoral academics, so a larger percentage are thus designated. In these areas, professors are scholars with doctorate degrees (typically PhD degrees) or equivalent qualifications who teach in four-year colleges and universities. An emeritus professor is a title given to selected retired professors with whom the university wishes to continue to be associated due to their stature and ongoing research. Emeritus professors do not receive a salary, but they are often given office or lab space, and use of libraries, labs, and so on.",

For one, \"accomplished\" strikes the reader as being a subjective claim, and \"recognized\" is vague--recognized by whom, and for what? On the other hand, one could argue that the professor's doctorate renders him or her \"recognized,\" and having earned that degree constitutes an \"accomplishment,\" but these connections are brittle. \n\nNotably, there is only one reference in the Chinese to \"university\" (大学), while in the English there are three.
